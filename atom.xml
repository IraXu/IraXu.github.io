WASHINGTON — Much of the world woke up on Thursday to the specter of an all-out war in Europe after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered his troops to invade Ukraine.<br>
华盛顿——周四，在俄罗斯总统普京下令军队入侵乌克兰之后，世界上很多人一觉醒来，便被欧洲爆发全面战争的恐惧所笼罩。</p>
<p>That left millions of people — in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, but also in the United States and elsewhere — wondering how the conflict would affect their lives.<br>
在乌克兰和东欧，以及在美国和其他地方，无数人想知道这场冲突将对他们的生活造成怎样的影响。</p>
<p>At least 40 Ukrainian solders were reported killed in the hours after the invasion, with estimates of tens of thousands of deaths over the course of the conflict.<br>
据报道，在入侵后的几个小时内，至少有40名乌克兰士兵死亡，估计在冲突期间会有数万人死亡。</p>
<p>But beyond the anticipated bloodshed, economic penalties to punish Russia will reverberate worldwide.<br>
但是，除了预期中的流血冲突之外，对俄罗斯的经济制裁将在全世界产生影响。</p>
<p>Rising energy costs and potentially slowing supply chains will take their toll on consumers. Russian cyberattacks could cripple electronic infrastructure.<br>
不断上涨的能源成本和可能的供应链放缓将对消费者造成影响。俄罗斯的网络攻击可能使电子基础设施瘫痪。</p>
<p>A new refugee crisis will require international assistance. And an era of relative calm in the West that has pervaded since the end of the Cold War might be coming to a close.<br>
一场新的难民危机将需要国际援助。西方自冷战结束以来相对平静的时代可能即将结束。</p>
<p>Here is what might happen next on the military, economic and diplomatic fronts.<br>
以下是接下来军事、经济和外交方面可能发生的情况。</p>
<h2 id="more-military-forces-head-to-natos-eastern-bordersbr更多军力前往北约东部边境">More military forces head to NATO's eastern borders<br>更多军力前往北约东部边境</h2>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645807160473.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>NATO announced on Thursday that it was sending reinforcements to its eastern flank, joining some 6,500 U.S. troops the Pentagon has already dispatched to Eastern Europe and the Baltics.<br>
北约周四宣布，它正在向其东翼派遣增援部队，另外五角大楼已经向东欧和波罗的海地区派遣了大约6500名美军。</p>
<p>“We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,” NATO said in a statement. “We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.”<br>
“我们正在联盟东部部署更多的防御性陆地和空军力量，以及更多的海上资产，”北约在声明中表示。“我们已经提高了部队应对所有突发事件的准备。”</p>
<p>The Pentagon is also repositioning about 1,000 troops in Europe. About 800 U.S. troops are moving to the Baltics from Italy; 20 Apache helicopters are heading to the Baltics from Germany, and 12 Apaches are going to Poland from Greece. Eight F-35 strike fighters are heading to Lithuania, Estonia and Romania from Germany, the Pentagon said.<br>
五角大楼还在重新部署欧洲的约1000名士兵。大约800名美军正从意大利向波罗的海转移；20架阿帕奇直升机正从德国调往波罗的海，12架阿帕奇直升机从希腊调往波兰。五角大楼表示，八架F-35战斗机正从德国飞往立陶宛、爱沙尼亚和罗马尼亚。</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. Army troops, including those from the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions, are preparing to move closer to Poland’s border with Ukraine to help process people fleeing the country, an Army spokesman said on Thursday.<br>
此外，美国陆军发言人周四表示，包括第82和101空降师在内的美国陆军部队正准备向波兰与乌克兰边境靠近，以帮助处理逃离该国的人。</p>
<p>Many of the 5,500 troops from the 18th Airborne Corps who arrived in Poland this month have been working with the State Department and Polish forces to set up three processing centers near the border to help deal with tens of thousands of people, including Americans, who are expected to flee Ukraine.<br>
本月抵达波兰的第18空降军团的5500名士兵中的许多人一直在与美国国务院和波兰部队合作，在边境附近建立三个处理中心，帮助处理包括美国人在内的数万名预计将逃离乌克兰的民众。</p>
<p>In Jasionka, Poland, an indoor arena has been outfitted with bunk beds and supplies for up to 500 people; U.S. officials say that capacity could be quickly expanded.<br>
在波兰的亚西翁卡，一个室内体育场已配备了双层床和各种用品，可以容纳500人；美国官员说，这一容量可以迅速扩大。</p>
<p>In Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Wednesday that he was prepared to accept refugees.<br>
奥地利总理卡尔·内哈默周三表示，他准备接受难民。</p>
<p>The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development are funding relief organizations that are currently providing food, water, shelter and emergency health care to people in the region who have fled to escape the violence.<br>
美国国务院和美国国际开发署正在为救援组织提供资金，这些组织目前正在为该地区逃离暴力的人们提供食物、水、住所和紧急医疗服务。</p>
<p>In the days to come, the C.I.A. will assess what kind of assistance it can provide to Ukraine. If a Ukrainian resistance develops in parts of the country that Russia seeks to control, the agency could secretly supply partisan forces with intelligence and, potentially, armaments.<br>
未来几天，中情局将就援助乌克兰进行评估。如果乌克兰的抵抗运动在俄罗斯试图控制的地区发展起来，该机构可以向游击队秘密提供情报，并有可能提供武器。</p>
<p>“We need to support the resistance to the invasion and the occupation in all ways possible,” said Mick Mulroy, a former C.I.A. paramilitary officer and senior Pentagon official in the Trump administration. “Our special operations and intelligence assets with an extensive knowledge base from 20 years of fighting insurgencies should be put to immediate use.”<br>
“我们需要以一切可能的方式支持对入侵和占领的抵抗，”前中情局准军事行动人员、特朗普政府的五角大楼高级官员米克·马尔罗伊说。“我们的特种作战和情报资产拥有20年打击叛乱分子的巨大知识储备，应该立即投入使用。”</p>
<h2 id="severe-sanctions-from-the-us-and-europebr来自美国和欧洲的严厉制裁">‘Severe’ sanctions from the U.S. and Europe<br>来自美国和欧洲的“严厉”制裁</h2>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645807181213.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>President Biden on Thursday plans to announce “severe sanctions” against Russia to try to deter Moscow from carrying out further violence in Ukraine and to punish it for its actions, U.S. officials said.<br>
美国官员说，拜登总统周四计划宣布对俄罗斯实施“严厉制裁”，以阻止莫斯科在乌克兰采取进一步的暴力行动，并对其行为进行惩罚。</p>
<p>The next set of economic sanctions is expected to be much harsher than what U.S. officials had described as a first tranche that was imposed on Monday and Tuesday.<br>
新的经济制裁措施预计将比美国官员所说的周一和周二实施的第一批制裁严厉得多。</p>
<p>Mr. Biden is likely to order the Treasury Department to put one or more large Russian state-owned banks on the agency’s list for the harshest sanctions, known as the S.D.N. list.<br>
拜登可能会命令财政部将一家或多家俄罗斯大型国有银行列入该机构最严厉的制裁名单，也就是所谓的SDN名单。</p>
<p>That would cut off the banks from commerce and exchanges with much of the world and affect many other Russian business operations.<br>
这将切断这些银行与世界大部分地区的商业和交流，并影响俄罗斯其他许多商业活动。</p>
<p>The Biden administration said on Tuesday that it was imposing that kind of sanctions on two banks, VEB and PSB, but those are policy banks with no retail operations in Russia.<br>
拜登政府周二表示，将对俄罗斯对外经济银行和俄罗斯工业通讯银行这两家银行实施此类制裁，但这两家银行是在俄罗斯没有零售业务的政策性银行。</p>
<p>Administration officials have studied how sanctions would affect each of the big banks, including Sberbank and VTB, Russia’s two largest banks.<br>
政府官员对制裁将如何影响俄罗斯所有大银行进行了研究，包括该国最大的两家银行俄罗斯储蓄银行和俄罗斯外贸银行。</p>
<p>Sberbank has about a third of the assets in the country’s banking sector, and VTB has more than 15 percent. Some experts are skeptical that the administration would put those two banks on the S.D.N. list for fear of the consequences for the Russian and global economies.<br>
俄罗斯储蓄银行拥有该国银行业约三分之一的资产，俄罗斯外贸银行拥有超过15%的资产。一些专家对政府是否会将这两家银行列入SDN名单持怀疑态度，因为政府可能对此举将给俄罗斯和全球经济造成的影响感到担心。</p>
<p>For now, U.S. officials are not ready to cut off all Russian banks from Swift, the important Belgian money transfer system used by more than 11,000 financial institutions worldwide.<br>
目前，美国官员还没有准备好切断所有俄罗斯银行与Swift的联系。Swift是比利时重要的汇款系统，被全球1.1万多家金融机构使用。</p>
<p>The Treasury Department has other sanctions lists that would impose costs while inflicting less widespread suffering. For example, it could put a bank on a list that prevents it from doing any transactions involving dollars. Many international commercial transactions are done in U.S. dollars, the currency that underpins the global economy.<br>
财政部还列出了其他制裁名单，这些名单在给俄罗斯造成损失的同时带来的痛苦相对会较小。例如，它可以将一家俄罗斯银行列入禁止其进行任何涉美元交易的名单。许多国际商业交易都是用美元这一支撑全球经济的货币进行的。</p>
<p>The Treasury Department is also expected to put more Russian officials, businesspeople and companies on the sanctions lists.<br>
预计美国财政部还将把更多俄罗斯官员、商人和公司列入制裁名单。</p>
<p>By Thursday afternoon in Russia, the nation’s stock market had fallen nearly 40 percent.<br>
截至周四下午，俄罗斯股市下跌了近40%。</p>
<p>The Commerce Department has been making plans to restrict the export of certain American technologies to Russia, a tactic that the Trump administration used to hobble Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company.<br>
商务部一直在制定计划，限制向俄罗斯出口某些美国技术，特朗普政府曾用这种策略打压中国的电信企业华为。</p>
<p>The controls would damage the supply chain for some Russian sectors. U.S. officials said their targets included the defense industry and the oil and gas industry.<br>
这些管制措施将损害俄罗斯一些行业的供应链。美国官员说，他们的目标包括国防工业以及石油和天然气行业。</p>
<p>European officials are expected to announce sanctions similar to many of the ones planned by the United States, as they did this week. However, they have been more wary of imposing the harshest sanctions because of the continent’s robust trade with Russia.<br>
预计欧洲官员将宣布与美国在本周计划的许多制裁类似的举措。但是，由于欧洲与俄罗斯的贸易往来更为频繁，他们对实施最严厉的制裁会持更加谨慎的态度。</p>
<p>Although Mr. Biden has said he will contemplate any possible sanctions, U.S. officials for now do not plan big disruptions to Russia’s energy exports, which are the pillar of the country’s economy. Europe relies on the products, and surging oil prices worldwide would cause greater inflation and more problems for politicians.<br>
虽然拜登表示他将考虑任何可能的制裁，但美国官员目前还不打算对作为俄罗斯经济支柱的能源出口作出重大破坏。欧洲依赖这些产品，并且全球油价飙升会导致更严重的通胀以及给政客带来更多问题。</p>
<p>However, Germany announces this week that it would not certify Nord Stream 2, a new natural gas pipeline that connects Russia and Western Europe. On Wednesday Mr. Biden announced sanctions on a subsidiary of Gazprom, the large Russian energy company, which built the pipeline and had planned to operate it.<br>
然而，德国本周宣布不会对连接俄罗斯和西欧的新天然气管道“北溪2号”进行认证。周三，拜登宣布对俄罗斯大型能源公司俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司的一家子公司实施制裁，这条管道由该公司建造和计划运营。</p>
<p>“We have been frank, we have been candid with the American people that our measures — the measures we have and are prepared to impose on the Russian Federation — certainly won’t be cost-free for the Russian Federation,” Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday. “But they won’t be entirely cost-free for the rest of the world as well.”<br>
“我们对美国人民开诚布公，我们的措施——我们对俄罗斯联邦已经实施以及准备实施的措施——对俄罗斯联邦来说肯定不会是没有代价的，”美国国务院发言人内德·普赖斯周三表示。“但对于世界其他地区来说，它们也不会完全没有代价。”</p>
<p>Even so, new economic burdens come at a difficult moment for Mr. Biden, who is grappling with voter frustration over inflation less than nine months before the midterm elections.<br>
即便如此，对于拜登来说，新的经济负担降临在一个艰难的时刻，距离中期选举还有不到九个月的时间，他正在努力应对选民对通胀的不满。</p>
<p>Republicans are expected to seize on additional domestic economic hardships to criticize Mr. Biden and Democrats. A strong faction of the Republican Party — led by President Donald J. Trump that includes the Fox News host Tucker Carlson — has been praising Russia, downplaying the importance of defending Ukraine and criticizing Mr. Biden for many policies. Some analysts say Mr. Putin sees such political division as a strategic advantage.<br>
预计共和党人将利用更多的国内经济困难来批评拜登和民主党人。共和党的一个强大派系——由特朗普总统领导，包括福克斯新闻主持人塔克·卡尔森——一直在赞扬俄罗斯，淡化保卫乌克兰的重要性，并批评拜登的许多政策。一些分析人士说，普京将这种政治分歧视为一种战略优势。</p>
<h2 id="diplomacy-in-turmoil-with-russias-path-of-aggressionbr外交因俄罗斯走上侵略之路而陷入混乱">Diplomacy in turmoil with Russia's ‘path of aggression’<br>外交因俄罗斯走上“侵略之路”而陷入混乱</h2>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645807200518.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>The State Department has moved its personnel to Poland from Ukraine, as diplomats continue to help the government in Kyiv and offer consular assistance to American citizens who want to leave Ukraine. Mr. Price estimated on Wednesday that far fewer Americans were in Ukraine than the 6,600 who were believed to be in the country in the fall.<br>
国务院已将在乌克兰的员工转移到波兰，外交官继续帮助基辅的乌克兰政府，并为想要离开乌克兰的美国公民提供领事协助。据信去年秋季有6600名美国人在乌克兰，普莱斯周三估计现在的人数已大大降低。</p>
<p>The larger question for the rest of the world is whether Mr. Putin’s invasion has irrevocably broken international systems in which Russia has been seen as a legitimate contributor.<br>
对世界其他国家来说，更大的问题是普京的入侵是否已经不可逆转地破坏了国际体系，在这一体系中，俄罗斯被视为合法促进者。</p>
<p>“Last night’s events are a turning point in the history of Europe and of our country,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said in an address on Thursday morning. “They will have lasting, profound consequences for our lives.”<br>
“昨晚的事件是欧洲历史和我国历史的转折点，”法国总统马克龙在周四上午的讲话中说。“它们将对我们的生活产生持久而深远的影响。”</p>
<p>Diplomats representing the Group of 7 of the world’s largest industrial nations, NATO, the U.N. Security Council and the European Council were set to meet later on Thursday to plot out the next steps.<br>
代表世界上最大的七个工业国、北约、联合国安理会和欧洲理事会的外交官定于周四晚些时候举行会议，制定下一步行动。</p>
<p>At the Security Council, the United States urged others to join a resolution condemning Russia’s aggressions and defending Ukraine’s sovereignty. The effort, which will be put to a vote on Friday, also calls for humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees and access for relief workers.<br>
在安理会，美国敦促其他国家加入一项谴责俄罗斯侵略和捍卫乌克兰主权的决议。这项工作将于周五进行投票，决议还呼吁向乌克兰难民提供人道主义援助，并允许救援人员进入。</p>
<p>But Russia has a permanent veto on the council, meaning it could derail any resolution the body proposes to rein in Mr. Putin.<br>
但俄罗斯在安理会拥有常任理事国的否决权，意味着它可以破坏安理会提出的任何牵制普京的决议。</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken may travel to Europe next week to meet allies and ensure that a unified front against Russia remains. He canceled a meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, that had been scheduled for Thursday in Geneva, describing it as unproductive as Russian troops took up battle formations.<br>
国务卿安东尼·布林肯可能会在下周前往欧洲与盟国会面，并确保维持对俄罗斯的统一战线。他取消了原定于周四在日内瓦与俄罗斯外交部长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫的会面，称由于俄罗斯军队已经出动，碰面徒劳无益。</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, even as he predicted that an assault was imminent, Mr. Blinken issued an 11th-hour appeal for Mr. Putin to take a diplomatic path from conflict.<br>
周三晚上，尽管布林肯预测攻击迫在眉睫，但他在最后一刻发出呼吁，要求普京选择外交途径解决冲突。</p>
<p>“If Russia demonstrates that it’s actually serious about that, which unfortunately it’s doing just the opposite, we’ll certainly pursue that,” Mr. Blinken said on ABC News. “But we’ve said all along that we’re prepared for this either way. We’re prepared to try to avert this diplomatically, through dialogue. We’re also prepared if Russia decides to choose the path of aggression.”<br>
“如果俄罗斯证明它真的想要解决冲突——不幸的是它所做的事情正相反——我们肯定会朝这个方向努力，”布林肯在美国广播公司新闻上说。“但我们一直都在说，无论哪种方式，我们都为此做好了准备。我们准备尝试通过对话以外交方式避免这种情况。如果俄罗斯决定选择侵略的道路，我们也做好了准备。”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether that path had been closed with the invasion.<br>
目前尚不清楚外交途径是否因入侵而关闭。</p>

<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, on Wednesday ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses as she sought to reassure those who see, in the Ukraine conflict, echoes of the self-governed territory’s own existential crisis.<br>
台湾台北——周三，台湾总统蔡英文下令该岛的武装部队和安全人员加强监视并加大防御，试图安抚那些从乌克兰冲突中看到这个自治地区生存危机的人。</p>
<p>Ms. Tsai’s instructions were delivered as a growing number of people within and outside the island are drawing parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, a democratically ruled territory that Beijing claims as its own.<br>
蔡英文的命令是在岛内外越来越多的人将乌克兰和台湾相提并论的时候发出的。北京认为这个实行民主统治的地方是中国的一部分。</p>
<p>Though the comparison is not perfect, Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor. Both China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have appealed to nostalgia for a glorious imperial past to justify their present-day territorial claims. Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands.<br>
虽然这种比较并不完全合适，但台湾和乌克兰一样，长期生活在一个庞大、霸道邻居的阴影下。中国领导人习近平和俄罗斯总统普京都诉诸帝国曾经的辉煌，为他们今天的领土主张辩护。正如普京向乌克兰接二连三发出威胁和要求一样，习近平也加大警告台湾，不要从中国独立。</p>
<p>“We empathize with Ukraine’s situation,” Ms. Tsai said late last month in announcing the creation of a task force to study the tensions in Ukraine.<br>
蔡英文在上个月底宣布成立一个工作组研究乌克兰的紧张局势时说：“我们对于乌克兰的处境感同身受。”</p>
<p>During a meeting with the task force on Wednesday, Ms. Tsai condemned Russia for “encroaching on Ukraine’s sovereignty.” She noted, however, that Taiwan was fundamentally different from Ukraine in its geopolitical, economic and geographical conditions.<br>
在周三与该工作组的会议中，蔡英文谴责俄罗斯“侵犯乌克兰的主权”。然而，她指出，台湾在地缘政治、经济和地理条件上与乌克兰有着根本的不同。</p>
<p>She called on her government to remain on high alert against what she described as “cognitive warfare” and disinformation efforts by foreign powers intent on using the tensions in Ukraine to stoke panic and instability in Taiwan.<br>
她呼吁她的政府针对她所说的“认知战”，以及外国势力企图利用乌克兰紧张局势在台湾引发恐慌和不稳定的虚假信息努力保持高度警惕。</p>
<p>While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an invasion of the island is imminent. Rather, the concern among some analysts in Taiwan is that a distracted West or a weak response to a Russian invasion in Ukraine could embolden the ruling Chinese Communist Party to ramp up pressure on the island.<br>
虽然北京现在定期向台湾出动战机，但没有迹象表明即将入侵台湾。相反，台湾一些分析人士担心的是，如果西方的注意力被分散，或对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的反应不力，可能会使执政的中共更加肆无忌惮地加大对该岛的施压。</p>
<p>Others have pointed to the tensions in Ukraine to criticize Ms. Tsai, who has kept a distance from Beijing while simultaneously bolstering ties with the United States and other Western countries.<br>
还有人则以乌克兰的紧张局势来批评蔡英文。她在与北京保持距离的同时，加强了与美国和其他西方国家的关系。</p>
<p>“The Ukraine outcome is right before our eyes,” Chao Chien-min, former deputy minister of Taiwan’s mainland affairs council, said at a conference on Tuesday, according to local news media reports. “Resisting China does not help protect Taiwan — it only accelerates our death.”<br>
“乌克兰的结果就在眼前，”据当地新闻媒体报道，台湾大陆委员会前副主委赵建民周二在一次会议上说。“抗中不可能保台，只会死得更快。”</p>
<p>Beijing has sought to maintain a balancing act on Ukraine, calling for respect for nations’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also implicitly acknowledging Mr. Putin’s grievances.<br>
北京试图在乌克兰问题上保持中立，呼吁尊重各国主权和领土完整，同时也含蓄地认同普京的不满。</p>
<p>It has made clear, however, that it sees Taiwan, which most countries do not recognize as a sovereign nation, as fundamentally different from Ukraine.<br>
然而，它也明确表示，它认为台湾与乌克兰有着本质的不同。大多数国家不承认台湾为主权国家。</p>
<p>“Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affairs,” Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press briefing on Wednesday.<br>
中国国台办发言人马晓光在周三的新闻发布会上说：“台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾问题纯属中国内政。”</p>

<p>In the early 1990s I was a roving correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, based in Europe. Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East.<br>
在20世纪90年代初，我是《华尔街日报》驻欧洲的一名机动记者。有那么几年，我感觉自己报道的全是好消息：苏联解体、乌克兰人投票支持独立、两德统一、民主在东欧的展开、曼德拉出狱和种族隔离制度的终结、奥斯陆和平进程似乎给中东带来了稳定。</p>
<p>I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order, democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations from within.<br>
我现在很怀念那些年。之所以这么说，是因为好时光没有持续下来。历史正在向野蛮倒退。我们看到的是：俄罗斯的威权强人威胁要入侵邻国；越来越威权主义的中国对人民发起种族灭绝，对台湾发起威胁；网络攻击正在破坏世界秩序；民主在全球范围内节节败退；西方的暴力民粹主义者正在从内部破坏国家。</p>
<p>What the hell happened? Why were the hopes of the 1990s not realized? What is the key factor that has made the 21st century so dark, regressive and dangerous?<br>
究竟发生了什么？为什么上世纪90年代的希望没能实现？究竟是什么让21世纪变得如此黑暗、退步和危险？</p>
<p>The normal thing to say is that the liberal world order is in crisis. But just saying that doesn’t explain why. Why are people rejecting liberalism? What weakness in liberalism are its enemies exploiting? What is at the root of this dark century? Let me offer one explanation.<br>
一般的说法是，自由主义的世界秩序正身陷危机。但仅仅这么说无法解释个中原因。为什么人们会反对自由主义？自由主义的敌人在利用自由主义的什么弱点？这个黑暗世纪的根源是什么？让我来给一个解释。</p>
<p>Liberalism is a way of life built on respect for the dignity of each individual. A liberal order, John Stuart Mill suggested, is one in which people are free to conduct “experiments in living” so you wind up with “a large variety in types of character.” There’s no one best way to live, so liberals celebrate freedom, personal growth and diversity.<br>
作为一种生活方式，自由主义建立在尊重每个人的尊严之上。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒认为，自由主义秩序是人们可以自由地进行“生活实验”，所以最终会存在“各种各样的性格类型”。没有一种最好的生活方式，所以自由主义者庆祝自由、个人成长和多样性。</p>
<p>Many of America’s founders were fervent believers in liberal democracy — up to a point. They had a profound respect for individual virtue, but also individual frailty. Samuel Adams said, “Ambitions and lust for power … are predominant passions in the breasts of most men.” Patrick Henry admitted to feelings of dread when he contemplated the “depravity of human nature.” One delegate to the constitutional convention said that the people “lack information and are constantly liable to be misled.”<br>
在一定程度上，许多美国的开国元勋都是自由民主的狂热信徒。他们极为尊重个人美德，但也非常尊重个体身上的弱点。塞缪尔·亚当斯说过：“对权力的野心和欲望……是大多数男人心中普遍存在的激情。”帕特里克·亨利承认，当他在思考“人性的堕落”时，会心生恐惧。一名参加制宪会议的代表说，人民“缺乏信息，总是容易被误导”。</p>
<p>Our founders were aware that majorities are easily led by ambitious demagogues.<br>
我们的开国元勋们意识到，大多数人很容易被野心勃勃的煽动家所怂恿。</p>
<p>So our founders built a system that respected popular opinion and majority rule while trying to build guardrails to check popular passion and prejudice. The crimes of the constitutional order are by now well known. It acquiesced to the existence of slavery and prolonged that institution for nearly another century. Early democratic systems enfranchised only a small share of adult Americans. But the genius of the Constitution was in its attempt to move toward democracy while trying to prevent undue concentrations of power. The founders divided power among the branches. They built in a whole series of republican checks, so that demagogues and populist crazes would not sweep over the land.<br>
因此，国父们建立起一个尊重民意、采行多数统治原则的体系，同时试图建造护栏来遏制民众的激情和偏见。这个宪政秩序的罪行如今已广为人知。它默许了奴隶制的存在，并让这一制度延长了近一个世纪。早期的民主制度只赋予了一小部分美国成年人选举权。但美国宪法的天才之处在于，它试图走向民主的同时，也试图防止权力过度集中。国父们将权力分配给不同机构。他们建立了一系列的共和制约，使得煽动者和民粹主义的狂热不会席卷整个国家。</p>
<p>“They designed a constitution for fallen people,” the historian Robert Tracy McKenzie writes in his book “We the Fallen People.” “Its genius lay in how it held in tension two seemingly incompatible beliefs: first, that the majority must generally prevail; and second, that the majority is predisposed to seek personal advantage above the common good.”<br>
“他们为堕落的人设计了一部宪法，”历史学家罗伯特·特雷西·麦肯齐《我们是堕落的人民》(We the Fallen People)一书中写道。“宪法的天才之处在于，它如何将两个看似不相容的信念矛盾地统一起来：第一个是，大多数人必须通常占上风；第二个是，大多数人容易将个人利益置于共同利益之上。”</p>
<p>While the Constitution guarded against abuses of power, the founders recognized that a much more important set of civic practices would mold people to be capable of being self-governing citizens: Churches were meant to teach virtue; leaders were to receive classical education, so they might understand human virtue and vice and the fragility of democracy; everyday citizens were to lead their lives as yeoman farmers so they might learn to live simply and work hard; civic associations and local government were to instill the habits of public service; patriotic rituals were observed to instill shared love of country; newspapers and magazines were there (more in theory than in fact) to create a well-informed citizenry; etiquette rules and democratic manners were adopted to encourage social equality and mutual respect.<br>
虽然宪法防范了权力滥用，但开国元勋们认识到，是一套更为重要的公民实践将人民塑造成有自治能力的公民：教会应该传授美德；领导者要接受古典教育，这样他们就有可能懂得人类的美德和邪恶，以及民主制度的脆弱；普通公民要像自耕农那样生活，这样他们就可能学会简单生活和努力工作；公民社团和地方政府要逐步培养人们公共服务的习惯；爱国仪式的庆祝会逐步培养人们对国家的共同热爱；报纸和杂志的存在（更多在理论上，而非事实上）是为了产生一个有见识的公民群体；采用礼仪规矩和民主行为方式是为了促进社会平等和相互尊重。</p>
<p>Think of it like farming. Planting the seeds is like establishing a democracy. But for democracy to function you have to till and fertilize the soil, erect fences, pull up weeds, prune the early growth. The founders knew that democracy is not natural. It takes a lot of cultivation to make democracy work.<br>
民主实践有点像务农。建立民主制度像是播下种子。但要让民主制度正常工作，你需要耕作，给土壤施肥，竖起篱笆，拔除杂草，修剪早枝。开国元勋们知道民主制度不是天生的。需要大量耕耘，才能让民主制度发挥作用。</p>
<p>American foreign policy had a second founding after World War II. For much of our history Americans were content to prosper behind the safety of the oceans. But after having been dragged into two world wars, a generation of Americans realized the old attitude wasn’t working any more and America, following the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would have to help build a liberal world order if it was to remain secure.<br>
第二次世界大战后，美国的外交政策得到了第二次创建。在我们历史上的大部分时间里，美国人曾满足于在大洋保护下的繁荣兴旺。但被迫卷入两次世界大战之后，一代美国人意识到，以前的态度不再可行，在富兰克林·罗斯福和哈里·杜鲁门领导下的美国，如果想保持一个安全环境，就必须帮助建立一个自由的世界秩序。</p>
<p>The postwar generation was a bit like the founding generation. Its leaders — from Truman to George F. Kennan to Reinhold Niebuhr — championed democracy, but they had no illusions about the depravity of human beings. They’d read their history and understood that stretching back thousands of years, war, authoritarianism, exploitation, great powers crushing little ones — these were just the natural state of human societies.<br>
“二战”后的一代有点像建国的那代。这代人中的领袖——从杜鲁门到乔治·凯南再到赖因霍尔德·尼布尔——为民主而斗争，但他们深知人类的堕落。他们读过人类的历史，知道上溯几千年，人类社会的自然状态是战争、专制、剥削、大国制伏小国。</p>
<p>If America was to be secure, Americans would have to plant the seeds of democracy, but also do all the work of cultivation so those seeds could flourish. Americans oversaw the creation of peaceful democracies from the ruins of military dictatorships in Germany and Japan. They funded the Marshall Plan. They helped build multinational institutions like NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund.<br>
如果美国想有安全的话，美国人就必须在全世界播下民主的种子，但同时也要做所有的耕耘，让这些种子茁壮成长。在美国人的监督下，德国和日本在军事独裁的废墟上建起了和平的民主制度。美国人为马歇尔计划提供了资金。他们帮助建立了北约、世界银行、国际货币基金组织等多国机构。</p>
<p>American military might stood ready to push back against the wolves who threatened the world order — sometimes effectively, as in Europe, but oftentimes, as in Vietnam and Iraq, recklessly and self-destructively. America championed democracy and human rights, at least when the Communists were violating them (not so much when our dictator allies across, say, Latin America were).<br>
美国的军事力量随时准备着抵制威胁世界秩序的恶狼，这种做法有时有效，比如在欧洲，但常常不计后果，导致自毁的结局，比如在越南和伊拉克。美国为民主和人权而斗争，至少在共产党人侵犯民主和人权时这样做（但当我们的独裁者盟友——比如拉丁美洲的那些——侵犯民主和人权时，就不太管了）。</p>
<p>Just as America’s founders understood that democracy is not natural, the postwar generation understood that peace is not natural — it has to be tended and cultivated from the frailties of human passion and greed.<br>
正如美国的开国元勋们懂得民主不是天生的一样，战后的一代也懂得和平不是天生的，和平需要呵护培育，以免人类激情和贪婪的弱点让其毁于一旦。</p>
<p>Over the past few generations that hopeful but sober view of human nature has faded. What’s been called the Culture of Narcissism took hold, with the view that human beings should be unshackled from restraint. You can trust yourself to be unselfish! Democracy and world peace were taken for granted. As Robert Kagan put it in his book “The Jungle Grows Back”: “We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable.”<br>
在过去几代人的时间里，这种对人性充满希望但又清醒的认识已经消失。一种被称为“自我陶醉的文化”开始盛行，认为人类应该不受任何约束力的束缚。你可以相信自己是无私的！民主制度和世界和平被认为是理所当然的东西。正如罗伯特·卡根在他的《丛林重新长起》(The Jungle Grows Back)一书中所言：“我们在自由秩序的泡泡中生活了太久，以至于我们无法想象其他类型的世界。我们认为这是天然的、正常的，甚至是不可避免的。”</p>
<p>If people are naturally good, we no longer have to do the hard agricultural work of cultivating virtuous citizens or fighting against human frailty. The Western advisers I covered in Russia in the early 1990s thought a lot about privatization and market reforms and very little about how to prevent greedy monsters from stealing the whole country. They had a naïve view of human nature.<br>
如果人性本善的话，我们就不需再为培养善良的公民进行艰苦的耕耘，或与人类的弱点作斗争。上世纪90年代初，我在俄罗斯采访过的那些西方顾问们对私有化和市场改革有很多想法，却很少思考如何防止贪婪的恶棍将整个国家的财富偷走的问题。他们对人性有一种幼稚的看法。</p>
<p>Even in America, over the past decades, the institutions that earlier generations thought were essential to molding a democratic citizenry have withered or malfunctioned. Many churches and media outlets have gone partisan. Civics education has receded. Neighborhood organizations have shrunk. Patriotic rituals are out of fashion.<br>
就连在美国，在过去的几十年里，前几代人认为对塑造民主公民至关重要的制度也已经枯萎或失灵。许多教会和媒体机构已经开始偏向党派。公民教育已逐渐减弱。社区组织已经萎缩。爱国仪式已经过时。</p>
<p>What happens when you don’t tend the seedbeds of democracy? Chaos? War? No, you return to normal. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were normal. Big countries like China, Russia and Turkey are ruled by fierce leaders with massive power. That’s normal. Small aristocracies in many nations hog gigantic shares of their nations’ wealth. That’s normal. Many people come to despise cultural outsiders, like immigrants. Normal. Global affairs resembles the law of the jungle, with big countries threatening small ones. This is the way it’s been for most of human history.<br>
如果你不去照料民主的苗床，会发生什么？混乱？战争？不是，你会回到常态。15、16、17、18世纪的常态。像中国、俄罗斯和土耳其这样的大国，都由权力巨大的凶残领导人统治，那是常态。许多国家的小部分贵族占有国家财富的巨大份额，那是常态。许多人开始鄙视文化外来者，比如移民，那是常态。全球事务类似丛林法则，大国威胁小国。这是人类历史上大部分时间的状态。</p>
<p>In normal times, people crave order and leaders like Vladimir Putin arise to give it to them. Putin and Xi Jinping have arisen to be the 21st century’s paradigmatic men.<br>
在常态时代，人们渴望秩序，出现像弗拉基米尔·普京这样的领导人，给予他们秩序。普京和习近平已作为21世纪的范式人物出现。</p>
<p>Putin has established political order in Russia by reviving the Russian strong state tradition and by concentrating power in the hands of one man. He has established economic order through a grand bargain with oligarch-led firms, with him as the ultimate C.E.O. As Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy write in their book, “Mr. Putin,” corruption is the glue that holds the system together. Everybody’s wealth is deliberately tainted, so Putin has the power to accuse anyone of corruption and remove anyone at any time.<br>
普京通过恢复俄罗斯强大国家的传统，通过将权力集中在一个人手中，在俄罗斯建立了政治秩序。他通过与寡头领导的公司大妥协，建立了经济秩序，当上了有最后决定权的首席执行官。正如菲奥娜·希尔和克利福德·加迪在《普京先生》(Mr. Putin)一书中所写的那样，腐败是将整个经济维系起来的粘合剂。故意让每个人的财富都不干净，这就让普京有指控任何人腐败、随时罢免任何人的权力。</p>
<p>He offers cultural order. He embraces the Russian Orthodox Church and rails against the postmodern godlessness of the West. He scorns homosexuality and transgenderism.<br>
他提供文化秩序。他欣然接受俄罗斯东正教会，抨击西方后现代社会的无神论。他鄙视同性恋和跨性别。</p>
<p>Putin has redefined global conservatism and made himself its global leader. Many conservatives around the world see Putin’s strong, manly authority, his defense of traditional values and his enthusiastic embrace of orthodox faith, and they see their aspirations in human form. Right-wing leaders from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen in France to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines speak of Putin admiringly.<br>
普京重新定义了全球保守主义，并将自己作为其全球领袖。世界各地的许多保守者看到普京强大、阳刚的权威，看到他捍卫传统价值观，看到他热情接受正统信仰，他们看到自己渴望的东西化作了人形。从美国的唐纳德·特朗普到法国的马琳·勒庞，再到菲律宾的罗德里戈·杜特尔特，这些右翼领导人都对普京充满钦佩之情。</p>
<p>The 21st century has become a dark century because the seedbeds of democracy have been neglected and normal historical authoritarianism is on the march. Putin and Xi seem confident that the winds of history are at their back. Writing in The Times a few weeks ago, Hill said that Putin believes the United States is in the same predicament Russia was in during the 1990s — “weakened at home and in retreat abroad.”<br>
21世纪已变成一个黑暗的世纪，因为民主的苗床无人照管，历史上的威权主义常态正在前进。普京和习近平似乎对自己身后是历史的潮流充满信心。希尔几周前在时报撰文写道，普京认为，美国处在与俄罗斯上世纪90年代所处的相同困境——“国内力量减弱，国外节节败退”。</p>
<p>Putin, Xi and the other global conservatives make comprehensive critiques of liberalism and the failings of liberal society. Unlike past authoritarians they have the massive power of modern surveillance technology to control their citizens. Russian troops are on the border of Ukraine because Putin needs to create the kind of disordered world that people like him thrive in. “The problem Russia has faced since the end of the Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be achieved in a world that is secure and stable,” Kagan writes in “The Jungle Grows Back.” “To achieve greatness on the world stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians nor anyone else enjoyed security.”<br>
普京、习近平，以及全球的其他保守者，对自由主义和自由社会的失败展开全面批判。与过去的独裁者不同，他们有强大的现代监控技术来控制其公民。俄罗斯军队在乌克兰边境集结，因为普京需要创造一个他这种人赖以生存的混乱世界。“自冷战结束以来，俄罗斯面临的问题是，普京和许多俄罗斯人所追求的那种伟大无法在一个安全稳定的世界中实现，”卡根在《丛林重新长起》一书中写道。“为了在世界舞台上一个有伟大地位，俄罗斯必须把世界带回到过去，带回到无论是俄罗斯人还是其他任何人都不享有安全的时代。”</p>
<p>Will the liberals of the world be able to hold off the wolves? Strengthen democracy and preserve the rules-based world order? The events of the past few weeks have been fortifying. Joe Biden and the other world leaders have done an impressive job of rallying their collective resolve and pushing to keep Putin within his borders. But the problems of democracy and the liberal order can’t be solved from the top down. Today, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, “endless wars” and domination. They don’t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it.<br>
全世界自由主义者能够抵挡住这些恶狼吗？能够加强民主制度、维护以规则为基础的世界秩序吗？过去几周发生的事情已增强了人们的信心。乔·拜登和其他世界领导人在凝聚共同的决心、努力让普京不越过他的边界方面做得非常出色。但是，不能用从上到下的办法解决民主制度和自由秩序的问题。今天，跨越从左到右政治派别的几百万美国人，把美国在海外的努力视为类似帝国主义、“无休止的战争”和主宰世界的事情。他们不相信战后计划，拒绝为这种计划提供选民支持。</p>
<p>The real problem is in the seedbeds of democracy, the institutions that are supposed to mold a citizenry and make us qualified to practice democracy. To restore those seedbeds, we first have to relearn the wisdom of the founders: We are not as virtuous as we think we are. Americans are no better than anyone else. Democracy is not natural; it is an artificial accomplishment that takes enormous work.<br>
真正的问题在于民主制度的苗床，在于那些本该塑造公民、让我们成为合格民主实践者的制度。要让这些苗床恢复健康，我们首先要重新学习建国元勋们的智慧：我们不像我们自己认为的那样有道德。美国人并不好于任何人。民主制度不是天生的；民主制度是需要付出巨大努力的人工构建。</p>
<p>Then we need to fortify the institutions that are supposed to teach the democratic skills: how to weigh evidence and commit to truth; how to correct for your own partisan blinders and learn to doubt your own opinions; how to respect people you disagree with; how to avoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking; how to avoid supporting demagogues; how to craft complex compromises.<br>
再有，我们需要加强本应传授民主技能的机构：如何慎重考虑证据，坚持事实；如何纠正自己的党派偏见，学会怀疑自己的观点；如何尊重与你意见相左的人；如何避免祸患论、阴谋论和末日论思维；如何避免支持蛊惑民心的政客；如何达成复杂的妥协方案。</p>
<p>Democrats are not born; they are made. If the 21st century is to get brighter as it goes along, we have to get a lot better at making them. We don’t only have to worry about the people tearing down democracy. We have to worry about who is building it up.<br>
民主实践者不是天生的，而是培养出来的。如果要让21世纪的未来变得越来越光明的话，我们必须在这方面做更多的努力。我们不仅要担心那些要摧毁民主制度的人。我们也必须关心那些将把这个制度变得更强的人。</p>
