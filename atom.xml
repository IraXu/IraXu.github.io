<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, on Wednesday ordered the island’s armed forces and security personnel to step up surveillance and strengthen defenses as she sought to reassure those who see, in the Ukraine conflict, echoes of the self-governed territory’s own existential crisis.<br>
台湾台北——周三，台湾总统蔡英文下令该岛的武装部队和安全人员加强监视并加大防御，试图安抚那些从乌克兰冲突中看到这个自治地区生存危机的人。</p>
<p>Ms. Tsai’s instructions were delivered as a growing number of people within and outside the island are drawing parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, a democratically ruled territory that Beijing claims as its own.<br>
蔡英文的命令是在岛内外越来越多的人将乌克兰和台湾相提并论的时候发出的。北京认为这个实行民主统治的地方是中国的一部分。</p>
<p>Though the comparison is not perfect, Taiwan, like Ukraine, has long lived in the shadow of a large and overbearing neighbor. Both China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have appealed to nostalgia for a glorious imperial past to justify their present-day territorial claims. Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands.<br>
虽然这种比较并不完全合适，但台湾和乌克兰一样，长期生活在一个庞大、霸道邻居的阴影下。中国领导人习近平和俄罗斯总统普京都诉诸帝国曾经的辉煌，为他们今天的领土主张辩护。正如普京向乌克兰接二连三发出威胁和要求一样，习近平也加大警告台湾，不要从中国独立。</p>
<p>“We empathize with Ukraine’s situation,” Ms. Tsai said late last month in announcing the creation of a task force to study the tensions in Ukraine.<br>
蔡英文在上个月底宣布成立一个工作组研究乌克兰的紧张局势时说：“我们对于乌克兰的处境感同身受。”</p>
<p>During a meeting with the task force on Wednesday, Ms. Tsai condemned Russia for “encroaching on Ukraine’s sovereignty.” She noted, however, that Taiwan was fundamentally different from Ukraine in its geopolitical, economic and geographical conditions.<br>
在周三与该工作组的会议中，蔡英文谴责俄罗斯“侵犯乌克兰的主权”。然而，她指出，台湾在地缘政治、经济和地理条件上与乌克兰有着根本的不同。</p>
<p>She called on her government to remain on high alert against what she described as “cognitive warfare” and disinformation efforts by foreign powers intent on using the tensions in Ukraine to stoke panic and instability in Taiwan.<br>
她呼吁她的政府针对她所说的“认知战”，以及外国势力企图利用乌克兰紧张局势在台湾引发恐慌和不稳定的虚假信息努力保持高度警惕。</p>
<p>While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an invasion of the island is imminent. Rather, the concern among some analysts in Taiwan is that a distracted West or a weak response to a Russian invasion in Ukraine could embolden the ruling Chinese Communist Party to ramp up pressure on the island.<br>
虽然北京现在定期向台湾出动战机，但没有迹象表明即将入侵台湾。相反，台湾一些分析人士担心的是，如果西方的注意力被分散，或对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的反应不力，可能会使执政的中共更加肆无忌惮地加大对该岛的施压。</p>
<p>Others have pointed to the tensions in Ukraine to criticize Ms. Tsai, who has kept a distance from Beijing while simultaneously bolstering ties with the United States and other Western countries.<br>
还有人则以乌克兰的紧张局势来批评蔡英文。她在与北京保持距离的同时，加强了与美国和其他西方国家的关系。</p>
<p>“The Ukraine outcome is right before our eyes,” Chao Chien-min, former deputy minister of Taiwan’s mainland affairs council, said at a conference on Tuesday, according to local news media reports. “Resisting China does not help protect Taiwan — it only accelerates our death.”<br>
“乌克兰的结果就在眼前，”据当地新闻媒体报道，台湾大陆委员会前副主委赵建民周二在一次会议上说。“抗中不可能保台，只会死得更快。”</p>
<p>Beijing has sought to maintain a balancing act on Ukraine, calling for respect for nations’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also implicitly acknowledging Mr. Putin’s grievances.<br>
北京试图在乌克兰问题上保持中立，呼吁尊重各国主权和领土完整，同时也含蓄地认同普京的不满。</p>
<p>It has made clear, however, that it sees Taiwan, which most countries do not recognize as a sovereign nation, as fundamentally different from Ukraine.<br>
然而，它也明确表示，它认为台湾与乌克兰有着本质的不同。大多数国家不承认台湾为主权国家。</p>
<p>“Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affairs,” Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press briefing on Wednesday.<br>
中国国台办发言人马晓光在周三的新闻发布会上说：“台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾问题纯属中国内政。”</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645690884928.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>In the early 1990s I was a roving correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, based in Europe. Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East.<br>
在20世纪90年代初，我是《华尔街日报》驻欧洲的一名机动记者。有那么几年，我感觉自己报道的全是好消息：苏联解体、乌克兰人投票支持独立、两德统一、民主在东欧的展开、曼德拉出狱和种族隔离制度的终结、奥斯陆和平进程似乎给中东带来了稳定。</p>
<p>I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order, democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations from within.<br>
我现在很怀念那些年。之所以这么说，是因为好时光没有持续下来。历史正在向野蛮倒退。我们看到的是：俄罗斯的威权强人威胁要入侵邻国；越来越威权主义的中国对人民发起种族灭绝，对台湾发起威胁；网络攻击正在破坏世界秩序；民主在全球范围内节节败退；西方的暴力民粹主义者正在从内部破坏国家。</p>
<p>What the hell happened? Why were the hopes of the 1990s not realized? What is the key factor that has made the 21st century so dark, regressive and dangerous?<br>
究竟发生了什么？为什么上世纪90年代的希望没能实现？究竟是什么让21世纪变得如此黑暗、退步和危险？</p>
<p>The normal thing to say is that the liberal world order is in crisis. But just saying that doesn’t explain why. Why are people rejecting liberalism? What weakness in liberalism are its enemies exploiting? What is at the root of this dark century? Let me offer one explanation.<br>
一般的说法是，自由主义的世界秩序正身陷危机。但仅仅这么说无法解释个中原因。为什么人们会反对自由主义？自由主义的敌人在利用自由主义的什么弱点？这个黑暗世纪的根源是什么？让我来给一个解释。</p>
<p>Liberalism is a way of life built on respect for the dignity of each individual. A liberal order, John Stuart Mill suggested, is one in which people are free to conduct “experiments in living” so you wind up with “a large variety in types of character.” There’s no one best way to live, so liberals celebrate freedom, personal growth and diversity.<br>
作为一种生活方式，自由主义建立在尊重每个人的尊严之上。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒认为，自由主义秩序是人们可以自由地进行“生活实验”，所以最终会存在“各种各样的性格类型”。没有一种最好的生活方式，所以自由主义者庆祝自由、个人成长和多样性。</p>
<p>Many of America’s founders were fervent believers in liberal democracy — up to a point. They had a profound respect for individual virtue, but also individual frailty. Samuel Adams said, “Ambitions and lust for power … are predominant passions in the breasts of most men.” Patrick Henry admitted to feelings of dread when he contemplated the “depravity of human nature.” One delegate to the constitutional convention said that the people “lack information and are constantly liable to be misled.”<br>
在一定程度上，许多美国的开国元勋都是自由民主的狂热信徒。他们极为尊重个人美德，但也非常尊重个体身上的弱点。塞缪尔·亚当斯说过：“对权力的野心和欲望……是大多数男人心中普遍存在的激情。”帕特里克·亨利承认，当他在思考“人性的堕落”时，会心生恐惧。一名参加制宪会议的代表说，人民“缺乏信息，总是容易被误导”。</p>
<p>Our founders were aware that majorities are easily led by ambitious demagogues.<br>
我们的开国元勋们意识到，大多数人很容易被野心勃勃的煽动家所怂恿。</p>
<p>So our founders built a system that respected popular opinion and majority rule while trying to build guardrails to check popular passion and prejudice. The crimes of the constitutional order are by now well known. It acquiesced to the existence of slavery and prolonged that institution for nearly another century. Early democratic systems enfranchised only a small share of adult Americans. But the genius of the Constitution was in its attempt to move toward democracy while trying to prevent undue concentrations of power. The founders divided power among the branches. They built in a whole series of republican checks, so that demagogues and populist crazes would not sweep over the land.<br>
因此，国父们建立起一个尊重民意、采行多数统治原则的体系，同时试图建造护栏来遏制民众的激情和偏见。这个宪政秩序的罪行如今已广为人知。它默许了奴隶制的存在，并让这一制度延长了近一个世纪。早期的民主制度只赋予了一小部分美国成年人选举权。但美国宪法的天才之处在于，它试图走向民主的同时，也试图防止权力过度集中。国父们将权力分配给不同机构。他们建立了一系列的共和制约，使得煽动者和民粹主义的狂热不会席卷整个国家。</p>
<p>“They designed a constitution for fallen people,” the historian Robert Tracy McKenzie writes in his book “We the Fallen People.” “Its genius lay in how it held in tension two seemingly incompatible beliefs: first, that the majority must generally prevail; and second, that the majority is predisposed to seek personal advantage above the common good.”<br>
“他们为堕落的人设计了一部宪法，”历史学家罗伯特·特雷西·麦肯齐《我们是堕落的人民》(We the Fallen People)一书中写道。“宪法的天才之处在于，它如何将两个看似不相容的信念矛盾地统一起来：第一个是，大多数人必须通常占上风；第二个是，大多数人容易将个人利益置于共同利益之上。”</p>
<p>While the Constitution guarded against abuses of power, the founders recognized that a much more important set of civic practices would mold people to be capable of being self-governing citizens: Churches were meant to teach virtue; leaders were to receive classical education, so they might understand human virtue and vice and the fragility of democracy; everyday citizens were to lead their lives as yeoman farmers so they might learn to live simply and work hard; civic associations and local government were to instill the habits of public service; patriotic rituals were observed to instill shared love of country; newspapers and magazines were there (more in theory than in fact) to create a well-informed citizenry; etiquette rules and democratic manners were adopted to encourage social equality and mutual respect.<br>
虽然宪法防范了权力滥用，但开国元勋们认识到，是一套更为重要的公民实践将人民塑造成有自治能力的公民：教会应该传授美德；领导者要接受古典教育，这样他们就有可能懂得人类的美德和邪恶，以及民主制度的脆弱；普通公民要像自耕农那样生活，这样他们就可能学会简单生活和努力工作；公民社团和地方政府要逐步培养人们公共服务的习惯；爱国仪式的庆祝会逐步培养人们对国家的共同热爱；报纸和杂志的存在（更多在理论上，而非事实上）是为了产生一个有见识的公民群体；采用礼仪规矩和民主行为方式是为了促进社会平等和相互尊重。</p>
<p>Think of it like farming. Planting the seeds is like establishing a democracy. But for democracy to function you have to till and fertilize the soil, erect fences, pull up weeds, prune the early growth. The founders knew that democracy is not natural. It takes a lot of cultivation to make democracy work.<br>
民主实践有点像务农。建立民主制度像是播下种子。但要让民主制度正常工作，你需要耕作，给土壤施肥，竖起篱笆，拔除杂草，修剪早枝。开国元勋们知道民主制度不是天生的。需要大量耕耘，才能让民主制度发挥作用。</p>
<p>American foreign policy had a second founding after World War II. For much of our history Americans were content to prosper behind the safety of the oceans. But after having been dragged into two world wars, a generation of Americans realized the old attitude wasn’t working any more and America, following the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would have to help build a liberal world order if it was to remain secure.<br>
第二次世界大战后，美国的外交政策得到了第二次创建。在我们历史上的大部分时间里，美国人曾满足于在大洋保护下的繁荣兴旺。但被迫卷入两次世界大战之后，一代美国人意识到，以前的态度不再可行，在富兰克林·罗斯福和哈里·杜鲁门领导下的美国，如果想保持一个安全环境，就必须帮助建立一个自由的世界秩序。</p>
<p>The postwar generation was a bit like the founding generation. Its leaders — from Truman to George F. Kennan to Reinhold Niebuhr — championed democracy, but they had no illusions about the depravity of human beings. They’d read their history and understood that stretching back thousands of years, war, authoritarianism, exploitation, great powers crushing little ones — these were just the natural state of human societies.<br>
“二战”后的一代有点像建国的那代。这代人中的领袖——从杜鲁门到乔治·凯南再到赖因霍尔德·尼布尔——为民主而斗争，但他们深知人类的堕落。他们读过人类的历史，知道上溯几千年，人类社会的自然状态是战争、专制、剥削、大国制伏小国。</p>
<p>If America was to be secure, Americans would have to plant the seeds of democracy, but also do all the work of cultivation so those seeds could flourish. Americans oversaw the creation of peaceful democracies from the ruins of military dictatorships in Germany and Japan. They funded the Marshall Plan. They helped build multinational institutions like NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund.<br>
如果美国想有安全的话，美国人就必须在全世界播下民主的种子，但同时也要做所有的耕耘，让这些种子茁壮成长。在美国人的监督下，德国和日本在军事独裁的废墟上建起了和平的民主制度。美国人为马歇尔计划提供了资金。他们帮助建立了北约、世界银行、国际货币基金组织等多国机构。</p>
<p>American military might stood ready to push back against the wolves who threatened the world order — sometimes effectively, as in Europe, but oftentimes, as in Vietnam and Iraq, recklessly and self-destructively. America championed democracy and human rights, at least when the Communists were violating them (not so much when our dictator allies across, say, Latin America were).<br>
美国的军事力量随时准备着抵制威胁世界秩序的恶狼，这种做法有时有效，比如在欧洲，但常常不计后果，导致自毁的结局，比如在越南和伊拉克。美国为民主和人权而斗争，至少在共产党人侵犯民主和人权时这样做（但当我们的独裁者盟友——比如拉丁美洲的那些——侵犯民主和人权时，就不太管了）。</p>
<p>Just as America’s founders understood that democracy is not natural, the postwar generation understood that peace is not natural — it has to be tended and cultivated from the frailties of human passion and greed.<br>
正如美国的开国元勋们懂得民主不是天生的一样，战后的一代也懂得和平不是天生的，和平需要呵护培育，以免人类激情和贪婪的弱点让其毁于一旦。</p>
<p>Over the past few generations that hopeful but sober view of human nature has faded. What’s been called the Culture of Narcissism took hold, with the view that human beings should be unshackled from restraint. You can trust yourself to be unselfish! Democracy and world peace were taken for granted. As Robert Kagan put it in his book “The Jungle Grows Back”: “We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable.”<br>
在过去几代人的时间里，这种对人性充满希望但又清醒的认识已经消失。一种被称为“自我陶醉的文化”开始盛行，认为人类应该不受任何约束力的束缚。你可以相信自己是无私的！民主制度和世界和平被认为是理所当然的东西。正如罗伯特·卡根在他的《丛林重新长起》(The Jungle Grows Back)一书中所言：“我们在自由秩序的泡泡中生活了太久，以至于我们无法想象其他类型的世界。我们认为这是天然的、正常的，甚至是不可避免的。”</p>
<p>If people are naturally good, we no longer have to do the hard agricultural work of cultivating virtuous citizens or fighting against human frailty. The Western advisers I covered in Russia in the early 1990s thought a lot about privatization and market reforms and very little about how to prevent greedy monsters from stealing the whole country. They had a naïve view of human nature.<br>
如果人性本善的话，我们就不需再为培养善良的公民进行艰苦的耕耘，或与人类的弱点作斗争。上世纪90年代初，我在俄罗斯采访过的那些西方顾问们对私有化和市场改革有很多想法，却很少思考如何防止贪婪的恶棍将整个国家的财富偷走的问题。他们对人性有一种幼稚的看法。</p>
<p>Even in America, over the past decades, the institutions that earlier generations thought were essential to molding a democratic citizenry have withered or malfunctioned. Many churches and media outlets have gone partisan. Civics education has receded. Neighborhood organizations have shrunk. Patriotic rituals are out of fashion.<br>
就连在美国，在过去的几十年里，前几代人认为对塑造民主公民至关重要的制度也已经枯萎或失灵。许多教会和媒体机构已经开始偏向党派。公民教育已逐渐减弱。社区组织已经萎缩。爱国仪式已经过时。</p>
<p>What happens when you don’t tend the seedbeds of democracy? Chaos? War? No, you return to normal. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were normal. Big countries like China, Russia and Turkey are ruled by fierce leaders with massive power. That’s normal. Small aristocracies in many nations hog gigantic shares of their nations’ wealth. That’s normal. Many people come to despise cultural outsiders, like immigrants. Normal. Global affairs resembles the law of the jungle, with big countries threatening small ones. This is the way it’s been for most of human history.<br>
如果你不去照料民主的苗床，会发生什么？混乱？战争？不是，你会回到常态。15、16、17、18世纪的常态。像中国、俄罗斯和土耳其这样的大国，都由权力巨大的凶残领导人统治，那是常态。许多国家的小部分贵族占有国家财富的巨大份额，那是常态。许多人开始鄙视文化外来者，比如移民，那是常态。全球事务类似丛林法则，大国威胁小国。这是人类历史上大部分时间的状态。</p>
<p>In normal times, people crave order and leaders like Vladimir Putin arise to give it to them. Putin and Xi Jinping have arisen to be the 21st century’s paradigmatic men.<br>
在常态时代，人们渴望秩序，出现像弗拉基米尔·普京这样的领导人，给予他们秩序。普京和习近平已作为21世纪的范式人物出现。</p>
<p>Putin has established political order in Russia by reviving the Russian strong state tradition and by concentrating power in the hands of one man. He has established economic order through a grand bargain with oligarch-led firms, with him as the ultimate C.E.O. As Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy write in their book, “Mr. Putin,” corruption is the glue that holds the system together. Everybody’s wealth is deliberately tainted, so Putin has the power to accuse anyone of corruption and remove anyone at any time.<br>
普京通过恢复俄罗斯强大国家的传统，通过将权力集中在一个人手中，在俄罗斯建立了政治秩序。他通过与寡头领导的公司大妥协，建立了经济秩序，当上了有最后决定权的首席执行官。正如菲奥娜·希尔和克利福德·加迪在《普京先生》(Mr. Putin)一书中所写的那样，腐败是将整个经济维系起来的粘合剂。故意让每个人的财富都不干净，这就让普京有指控任何人腐败、随时罢免任何人的权力。</p>
<p>He offers cultural order. He embraces the Russian Orthodox Church and rails against the postmodern godlessness of the West. He scorns homosexuality and transgenderism.<br>
他提供文化秩序。他欣然接受俄罗斯东正教会，抨击西方后现代社会的无神论。他鄙视同性恋和跨性别。</p>
<p>Putin has redefined global conservatism and made himself its global leader. Many conservatives around the world see Putin’s strong, manly authority, his defense of traditional values and his enthusiastic embrace of orthodox faith, and they see their aspirations in human form. Right-wing leaders from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen in France to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines speak of Putin admiringly.<br>
普京重新定义了全球保守主义，并将自己作为其全球领袖。世界各地的许多保守者看到普京强大、阳刚的权威，看到他捍卫传统价值观，看到他热情接受正统信仰，他们看到自己渴望的东西化作了人形。从美国的唐纳德·特朗普到法国的马琳·勒庞，再到菲律宾的罗德里戈·杜特尔特，这些右翼领导人都对普京充满钦佩之情。</p>
<p>The 21st century has become a dark century because the seedbeds of democracy have been neglected and normal historical authoritarianism is on the march. Putin and Xi seem confident that the winds of history are at their back. Writing in The Times a few weeks ago, Hill said that Putin believes the United States is in the same predicament Russia was in during the 1990s — “weakened at home and in retreat abroad.”<br>
21世纪已变成一个黑暗的世纪，因为民主的苗床无人照管，历史上的威权主义常态正在前进。普京和习近平似乎对自己身后是历史的潮流充满信心。希尔几周前在时报撰文写道，普京认为，美国处在与俄罗斯上世纪90年代所处的相同困境——“国内力量减弱，国外节节败退”。</p>
<p>Putin, Xi and the other global conservatives make comprehensive critiques of liberalism and the failings of liberal society. Unlike past authoritarians they have the massive power of modern surveillance technology to control their citizens. Russian troops are on the border of Ukraine because Putin needs to create the kind of disordered world that people like him thrive in. “The problem Russia has faced since the end of the Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be achieved in a world that is secure and stable,” Kagan writes in “The Jungle Grows Back.” “To achieve greatness on the world stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians nor anyone else enjoyed security.”<br>
普京、习近平，以及全球的其他保守者，对自由主义和自由社会的失败展开全面批判。与过去的独裁者不同，他们有强大的现代监控技术来控制其公民。俄罗斯军队在乌克兰边境集结，因为普京需要创造一个他这种人赖以生存的混乱世界。“自冷战结束以来，俄罗斯面临的问题是，普京和许多俄罗斯人所追求的那种伟大无法在一个安全稳定的世界中实现，”卡根在《丛林重新长起》一书中写道。“为了在世界舞台上一个有伟大地位，俄罗斯必须把世界带回到过去，带回到无论是俄罗斯人还是其他任何人都不享有安全的时代。”</p>
<p>Will the liberals of the world be able to hold off the wolves? Strengthen democracy and preserve the rules-based world order? The events of the past few weeks have been fortifying. Joe Biden and the other world leaders have done an impressive job of rallying their collective resolve and pushing to keep Putin within his borders. But the problems of democracy and the liberal order can’t be solved from the top down. Today, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, “endless wars” and domination. They don’t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it.<br>
全世界自由主义者能够抵挡住这些恶狼吗？能够加强民主制度、维护以规则为基础的世界秩序吗？过去几周发生的事情已增强了人们的信心。乔·拜登和其他世界领导人在凝聚共同的决心、努力让普京不越过他的边界方面做得非常出色。但是，不能用从上到下的办法解决民主制度和自由秩序的问题。今天，跨越从左到右政治派别的几百万美国人，把美国在海外的努力视为类似帝国主义、“无休止的战争”和主宰世界的事情。他们不相信战后计划，拒绝为这种计划提供选民支持。</p>
<p>The real problem is in the seedbeds of democracy, the institutions that are supposed to mold a citizenry and make us qualified to practice democracy. To restore those seedbeds, we first have to relearn the wisdom of the founders: We are not as virtuous as we think we are. Americans are no better than anyone else. Democracy is not natural; it is an artificial accomplishment that takes enormous work.<br>
真正的问题在于民主制度的苗床，在于那些本该塑造公民、让我们成为合格民主实践者的制度。要让这些苗床恢复健康，我们首先要重新学习建国元勋们的智慧：我们不像我们自己认为的那样有道德。美国人并不好于任何人。民主制度不是天生的；民主制度是需要付出巨大努力的人工构建。</p>
<p>Then we need to fortify the institutions that are supposed to teach the democratic skills: how to weigh evidence and commit to truth; how to correct for your own partisan blinders and learn to doubt your own opinions; how to respect people you disagree with; how to avoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking; how to avoid supporting demagogues; how to craft complex compromises.<br>
再有，我们需要加强本应传授民主技能的机构：如何慎重考虑证据，坚持事实；如何纠正自己的党派偏见，学会怀疑自己的观点；如何尊重与你意见相左的人；如何避免祸患论、阴谋论和末日论思维；如何避免支持蛊惑民心的政客；如何达成复杂的妥协方案。</p>
<p>Democrats are not born; they are made. If the 21st century is to get brighter as it goes along, we have to get a lot better at making them. We don’t only have to worry about the people tearing down democracy. We have to worry about who is building it up.<br>
民主实践者不是天生的，而是培养出来的。如果要让21世纪的未来变得越来越光明的话，我们必须在这方面做更多的努力。我们不仅要担心那些要摧毁民主制度的人。我们也必须关心那些将把这个制度变得更强的人。</p>

After getting battered by the pandemic, supply chain chokeholds and leaps in prices, the global economy is poised to be sent on yet another unpredictable course by an armed clash on Europe’s border.<br>
在受到大流行、供应链受阻和价格暴涨的打击之后，全球经济将因欧洲边境的武装冲突而走上又一条不可预测的道路。</p>
<p>Even before the Kremlin ordered Russian troops into separatist territories of Ukraine on Monday, the tension had taken a toll. The promise of punishing sanctions in return by President Biden and the potential for Russian retaliation had already pushed down stock returns and driven up gas prices.<br>
早在克里姆林宫周一下令俄罗斯军队进入寻求分裂的乌克兰地区之前，紧张局势就已经造成了损失。拜登总统以严厉制裁作为回应的承诺以及俄罗斯进行报复的可能性已经压低了股票回报并推高了汽油价格。</p>
<p>An outright attack by Russian troops could cause dizzying spikes in energy and food prices, fuel inflation fears and spook investors, a combination that threatens investment and growth in economies around the world.<br>
俄罗斯军队的直接攻击可能会导致能源和食品价格飙升，加剧通胀担忧并吓跑投资者，这些因素会威胁到全球经济体的投资和增长。</p>
<p>However harsh the effects, the immediate impact will be nowhere near as devastating as the sudden economic shutdowns first caused by the coronavirus in 2020. Russia is a transcontinental behemoth with 146 million people and a huge nuclear arsenal, as well as a key supplier of the oil, gas and raw materials that keep the world’s factories running. But unlike China, which is a manufacturing powerhouse and intimately woven into intricate supply chains, Russia is a minor player in the global economy.<br>
无论影响多么严重，其直接影响远不及2020年由新冠病毒首次造成的经济骤然停摆那样具有破坏性。俄罗斯是一个横贯大陆的巨型国家，拥有1.46亿人口和庞大的核武库，也是维持世界工厂运转的石油、天然气和原材料的供应国。但与中国不同，中国是紧密融入错综复杂供应链的制造业强国，而俄罗斯在全球经济中只是一个小角色。</p>
<p>Italy, with half the people and fewer natural resources, has an economy that is twice the size. Poland exports more goods to the European Union than Russia.<br>
意大利的人口约为俄罗斯的一半，自然资源相对较少，但其经济规模是俄罗斯的两倍。波兰向欧盟出口的商品比俄罗斯多。</p>
<p>“Russia is incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was an adviser to President Barack Obama. “It’s basically a big gas station.”<br>
“除了石油和天然气，俄罗斯在全球经济中毫不重要，这令人难以置信，”哈佛大学经济学家、贝拉克·奥巴马总统顾问杰森·弗曼说。“它基本上是一个大加油站。”<br>
<img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645700737602.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Of course, a closed gas station can be crippling for those who depend on it. The result is that any economic damage will be unevenly spread, intense in some countries and industries and unnoticed in others.<br>
当然，一个关闭的加油站对于那些依赖它的人来说可能导致严重损失。其结果是经济损失分布不均匀，一些国家和行业受损严重，而在另一些国家和行业中则不会引起注意。</p>
<p>Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia, and is likely to be walloped with spikes in heating and gas bills, which are already soaring. Natural gas reserves are at less than a third of capacity, with weeks of cold weather ahead, and European leaders have already accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.<br>
欧洲近40%的天然气和25%的石油来自俄罗斯，并且很可能会受到已经飙升的供暖和天然气费用的冲击。由于未来数周的寒冷天气，天然气储量不到总容量的三分之一，欧洲领导人已经指责俄罗斯总统普京为了获取政治优势而减少供应。</p>
<p>And then there are food prices, which have climbed to their highest level in more than a decade largely because of the pandemic’s supply chain mess, according to a recent United Nations report. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat, and together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. For some countries, the dependence is much greater. That flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of Egypt and Turkey’s total wheat imports.<br>
此外，根据联合国最近的一份报告，食品价格已攀升至十多年来的最高水平，大流行导致的供应链混乱是主要原因。俄罗斯是世界上最大的小麦供应国，与乌克兰一起占全球出口总量的近四分之一。一些国家对小麦的依赖性更高。来自那里的小麦占埃及和土耳其小麦进口总量的70%以上。</p>
<p>This will put further strain on Turkey, which is already in the middle of an economic crisis and struggling with inflation that is running close to 50 percent, with skyrocketing food, fuel and electricity prices.<br>
这将给土耳其带来进一步的压力，该国已经处于经济危机之中，并且正在努力应对接近50%的通货膨胀，食品、燃料和用电价格飞涨。</p>
<p>And as usual, the burden falls heaviest on the most vulnerable. “Poorer people spend a higher share of incomes on food and heating,” said Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at Oxford University.<br>
和往常一样，最脆弱的群体承受着最重的负担。牛津大学全球化与发展学教授伊恩·戈尔丁说：“穷人在食物和取暖方面花费占收入比例更高。”</p>
<p>Ukraine, long known as the “breadbasket of Europe,” actually sends more than 40 percent of its wheat and corn exports to the Middle East or Africa, where there are worries that further food shortages and price increases could stoke social unrest.<br>
长期以来被称为“欧洲粮仓”的乌克兰实际上将40%以上的小麦和玉米出口运送到中东或非洲，人们担心进一步的粮食短缺和价格上涨可能引发社会动荡。</p>
<p>Lebanon, for example, which is experiencing one of the most devastating economic crises in more than a century, gets more than half of its wheat from Ukraine, which is also the world’s largest exporter of seed oils like sunflower and rapeseed.<br>
例如，黎巴嫩正经历一个多世纪以来最具破坏性的经济危机之一，其一半以上的小麦来自乌克兰，乌克兰也是世界上最大的葵花籽油和菜籽油等种子油的出口国。</p>
<p>On Monday, the White House responded to Mr. Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of two Russian-backed territories in the country’s east by saying it would begin imposing limited sanctions on the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Biden would soon issue an executive order prohibiting investment, trade and financing with people in those regions.<br>
对于普京承认乌克兰东部两个俄罗斯支持的区域独立的决定，白宫于周一作出回应，称将开始对所谓的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克人民共和国实施有限制裁。白宫新闻秘书珍·萨基表示，拜登将很快发布一项行政命令，禁止与这些地区的人进行投资、贸易和融资交易。</p>
<p>Analysts watching the unfolding conflict have mapped out a range of scenarios from mild to severe. The fallout on working-class families and Wall Street traders depends on how an invasion plays out: whether Russian troops stay near the border or attack the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv; whether the fighting lasts for days or months; what kind of Western sanctions are imposed; and whether Mr. Putin responds by withholding critical gas supplies from Europe or launching insidious cyberattacks.<br>
正在关注事态的分析人士已经列举了程度不一的一系列可能情况。冲突对工人阶级家庭和华尔街交易员各有什么样的影响，取决于入侵的结果：俄罗斯军队是留在边境附近还是袭击乌克兰首都基辅；战斗是持续几天还是几个月；西方实施了什么样的制裁；以及普京是否会通过暂停欧洲至关重要的天然气供应或发动阴险的网络攻击来做出回应。</p>
<p>“Think about it rolling out in stages,” said Julia Friedlander, director of the economic statecraft initiative at the Atlantic Council. “This is likely to play out as a slow motion drama.”<br>
“估计会是分阶段展开的，”大西洋理事会经济治国计划主任朱莉娅·弗里德兰德说。“这很可能会以一种慢动作戏剧的形式上演。”</p>
<p>As became clear from the pandemic, minor interruptions in one region can generate major disruptions far away. Isolated shortages and price surges— whether of gas, wheat, aluminum or nickel — can snowball in a world still struggling to recover from the pandemic.<br>
从大流行中可以清楚地看出，一个地区的轻微扰动可能会在遥远的地方产生重大破坏。世界仍在努力从大流行中恢复过来，孤立的短缺和价格飙升——无论是天然气、小麦、铝还是镍——都可能像滚雪球一样越来越严重。</p>
<p>“You have to look at the backdrop against which this is coming,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY-Parthenon. “There is high inflation, strained supply chains and uncertainty about what central banks are going to do and how insistent price rises are.”<br>
“对于这种即将到来的情况，你必须考虑它所处的背景，”安永-帕特农首席经济学家格雷戈里·达科表示。“存在高通胀、供应链紧张，而且不确定央行会怎么做，也不确定物价上涨会持续多久。”<br>
<img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645700884573.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The additional stresses may be relatively small in isolation, but they are piling on economies that are still recovering from the economic body blows inflicted by the pandemic.<br>
额外的压力单独来看可能相对不大，但它们堆积在仍在从大流行造成的打击中复苏的经济体上。</p>
<p>What’s also clear, Mr. Daco added, is that “political uncertainty and volatility weigh on economic activity.”<br>
达科还说，还可以明确的是，“政治不确定性和波动性会影响经济活动。”</p>
<p>That means an invasion could have a dual effect — slowing economic activity and raising prices.<br>
这意味着入侵可能会产生双重影响——经济活动放缓和价格上涨。</p>
<p>In the United States, the Federal Reserve is already confronting the highest inflation in 40 years, at 7.5 percent in January, and is expected to start raising interest rates next month. Higher energy prices set off by a conflict in Europe may be transitory but they could feed worries about a wage-price spiral.<br>
在美国，美联储已经面临40年来的最高通胀，1月份为7.5%，预计下个月将开始加息。欧洲冲突引发的能源价格上涨可能是暂时的，但它们可能会引发对工资价格螺旋上升的担忧。</p>
<p>“We could see a new burst of inflation,” said Christopher Miller, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and an assistant professor at Tufts University.<br>
美国企业研究所客座研究员、塔夫茨大学助理教授克里斯托弗·米勒说：“我们可能会看到新一轮的通胀爆发。”</p>
<p>Also fueling inflation fears are possible shortages of essential metals like palladium, aluminum and nickel, creating another disruption to global supply chains already suffering from the pandemic, trucker blockades in Canada and shortages of semiconductors.<br>
钯、铝和镍等基本金属可能会短缺，这也加剧了对通胀的担忧，这对已经遭受大流行、加拿大卡车司机罢工和半导体短缺影响的全球供应链造成了又一次破坏。</p>
<p>The price of palladium, for example, used in automotive exhaust systems, mobile phones and even dental fillings, has soared in recent weeks because of fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, used to make steel and electric car batteries, has also been jumping.<br>
例如，用于汽车排气系统、手机甚至齿科填充物的钯金属的价格在最近几周飙升，原因是担心这种金属的全球最大出口国俄罗斯可能会被全球市场拒之门外。用于制造钢铁和电动汽车电池的镍的价格也一直在上涨。</p>
<p>It’s too early to gauge the precise impact of an armed conflict, said Lars Stenqvist, the chief technology officer of Volvo, the Swedish truck maker. But he added, “It is a very, very serious thing.”<br>
瑞典卡车制造商沃尔沃的首席技术官拉尔斯·斯滕奎斯特表示，现在评估武装冲突的确切影响还为时过早。但他还说，“这是一件非常非常严重的事情。”</p>
<p>“We have a number of scenarios on the table and we are following the developments of the situation day by day,” Mr. Stenqvist said Monday.<br>
斯滕奎斯特周一表示：“我们需要考虑的情况有很多，我们每天都在关注事态的发展。”</p>
<p>The West has taken steps to blunt the impact on Europe if Mr. Putin decides to retaliate. The United States has ramped up delivery of liquefied natural gas and asked other suppliers like Qatar to do the same.<br>
普京若要决定进行报复，西方已采取措施缓和对欧洲的影响。美国增加了液化天然气的供应，并要求卡塔尔等其他供应国也这样做。<br>
<img src="https://iraxu.github.io//post-images/1645700899229.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The demand for oil might add momentum to negotiations to revive a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, which is estimated to have as many as 80 million barrels of oil in storage, has been locked out of much of the world’s markets since 2018, when President Donald J. Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord and reimposed sanctions.<br>
对石油的需求可能会为恢复遏制伊朗核计划的协议增加谈判的动力。据估计，伊朗拥有多达8000万桶石油储备，自2018年特朗普总统退出核协议并重新实施制裁以来，它一直被排除在世界大部分市场之外。</p>
<p>Some of the sanctions against Russia that the Biden administration is considering, such as cutting off access to the system of international payments known as SWIFT or blocking companies from selling anything to Russia that contains American-made components, would hurt anyone who does business with Russia. But across the board, the United States is much less vulnerable than the European Union, which is Russia’s largest trading partner.<br>
拜登政府正在考虑对俄罗斯实施的一些制裁措施——例如切断俄罗斯对被称为SWIFT的国际支付系统的访问权限，或阻止公司向俄罗斯出售任何含有美国制造组件的产品——将损害所有与俄罗斯有业务往来的人。但总体而言，美国的受损程度远不及俄罗斯最大的贸易伙伴欧盟。</p>
<p>Americans, as Mr. Biden has already warned, are likely to see higher gasoline prices. But because the United States is itself a large producer of natural gas, those price increases are not nearly as steep and as broad as elsewhere. And Europe has many more links to Russia and engages in more financial transactions — including paying for the Russian gas.<br>
正如拜登已经警告的那样，美国人可能会面临更高的汽油价格。但由于美国本身就是一个天然气生产大国，因此这些价格上涨幅度并不像其他地方那么剧烈和广泛。而欧洲与俄罗斯的联系更多，参与的金融交易也更多——包括购买俄罗斯天然气的交易。</p>
<p>Oil companies like Shell and Total have joint ventures in Russia, while BP boasts that it “is one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia,” with ties to the Russian oil company Rosneft. Airbus, the European aviation giant, gets titanium from Russia. And European banks, particularly those in Germany, France and Italy, have lent billions of dollars to Russian borrowers.<br>
壳牌和道达尔等石油公司在俄罗斯有合资企业，而英国石油则夸耀自己是“俄罗斯最大的外国投资者之一”，与俄罗斯石油公司有联系。欧洲航空巨头空中客车公司从俄罗斯进口钛。欧洲的银行，尤其是德国、法国和意大利的银行，已经向俄罗斯债务方提供了数十亿美元的贷款。</p>
<p>“Severe sanctions that hurt Russia painfully and comprehensively have potential to do huge damage to European customers,” said Adam Tooze, director of the European Institute at Columbia University.<br>
哥伦比亚大学欧洲研究所所长亚当·图兹表示：“对俄罗斯造成痛苦和全面伤害的严厉制裁有可能对欧洲客户造成巨大损害。”</p>
<p>Depending on what happens, the most significant effects on the global economy may manifest themselves only over the long run.<br>
根据所发生的情况，对全球经济最重要的影响可能只有在长期内才会显现出来。</p>
<p>One result would be to push Russia to have closer economic ties to China. The two nations recently negotiated a 30-year contract for Russia to supply gas to China through a new pipeline.<br>
其中一个结果将是推动俄罗斯与中国建立更紧密的经济联系。两国最近就俄罗斯通过一条新管道向中国供应天然气的30年合同进行了谈判。</p>
<p>“Russia is likely to pivot all energy and commodity exports to China,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.<br>
高频经济首席经济学家卡尔·温伯格表示：“俄罗斯可能会将所有能源和大宗商品出口转向中国。”</p>
<p>The crisis is also contributing to a reassessment of the global economy’s structure and concerns about self-sufficiency. The pandemic has already highlighted the downsides of far-flung supply chains that rely on lean production.<br>
这场危机也促成了对全球经济结构的重新评估和对自给自足的担忧。疫情已经凸显了依赖精益生产的远距离供应链的弊端。</p>
<p>Now Europe’s dependence on Russian gas is spurring discussions about expanding energy sources, which could further sideline Russia’s presence in the global economy.<br>
如今，欧洲对俄罗斯天然气的依赖引发了有关扩大能源来源的讨论，这可能会进一步削弱俄罗斯在全球经济中的地位。</p>
<p>“In the longer term, it’s going to push Europe to diversify,” said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow working on international trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. As for Russia, the real cost “would be corrosive over time and really making it much more difficult to do business with Russian entities and deterring investment.”<br>
彼得森国际经济研究所国际贸易政策高级研究员杰弗里·肖特说：“长期来看，这将推动欧洲走向多元化。”至于俄罗斯，真正的成本“将随着时间的推移而恶化，真的会大大增加与俄罗斯实体做生意的难度，并阻碍投资。”</p>
