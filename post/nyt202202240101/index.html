<p>In the early 1990s I was a roving correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, based in Europe. Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East.<br>
在20世纪90年代初，我是《华尔街日报》驻欧洲的一名机动记者。有那么几年，我感觉自己报道的全是好消息：苏联解体、乌克兰人投票支持独立、两德统一、民主在东欧的展开、曼德拉出狱和种族隔离制度的终结、奥斯陆和平进程似乎给中东带来了稳定。</p>
<p>I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order, democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations from within.<br>
我现在很怀念那些年。之所以这么说，是因为好时光没有持续下来。历史正在向野蛮倒退。我们看到的是：俄罗斯的威权强人威胁要入侵邻国；越来越威权主义的中国对人民发起种族灭绝，对台湾发起威胁；网络攻击正在破坏世界秩序；民主在全球范围内节节败退；西方的暴力民粹主义者正在从内部破坏国家。</p>
<p>What the hell happened? Why were the hopes of the 1990s not realized? What is the key factor that has made the 21st century so dark, regressive and dangerous?<br>
究竟发生了什么？为什么上世纪90年代的希望没能实现？究竟是什么让21世纪变得如此黑暗、退步和危险？</p>
<p>The normal thing to say is that the liberal world order is in crisis. But just saying that doesn’t explain why. Why are people rejecting liberalism? What weakness in liberalism are its enemies exploiting? What is at the root of this dark century? Let me offer one explanation.<br>
一般的说法是，自由主义的世界秩序正身陷危机。但仅仅这么说无法解释个中原因。为什么人们会反对自由主义？自由主义的敌人在利用自由主义的什么弱点？这个黑暗世纪的根源是什么？让我来给一个解释。</p>
<p>Liberalism is a way of life built on respect for the dignity of each individual. A liberal order, John Stuart Mill suggested, is one in which people are free to conduct “experiments in living” so you wind up with “a large variety in types of character.” There’s no one best way to live, so liberals celebrate freedom, personal growth and diversity.<br>
作为一种生活方式，自由主义建立在尊重每个人的尊严之上。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒认为，自由主义秩序是人们可以自由地进行“生活实验”，所以最终会存在“各种各样的性格类型”。没有一种最好的生活方式，所以自由主义者庆祝自由、个人成长和多样性。</p>
<p>Many of America’s founders were fervent believers in liberal democracy — up to a point. They had a profound respect for individual virtue, but also individual frailty. Samuel Adams said, “Ambitions and lust for power … are predominant passions in the breasts of most men.” Patrick Henry admitted to feelings of dread when he contemplated the “depravity of human nature.” One delegate to the constitutional convention said that the people “lack information and are constantly liable to be misled.”<br>
在一定程度上，许多美国的开国元勋都是自由民主的狂热信徒。他们极为尊重个人美德，但也非常尊重个体身上的弱点。塞缪尔·亚当斯说过：“对权力的野心和欲望……是大多数男人心中普遍存在的激情。”帕特里克·亨利承认，当他在思考“人性的堕落”时，会心生恐惧。一名参加制宪会议的代表说，人民“缺乏信息，总是容易被误导”。</p>
<p>Our founders were aware that majorities are easily led by ambitious demagogues.<br>
我们的开国元勋们意识到，大多数人很容易被野心勃勃的煽动家所怂恿。</p>
<p>So our founders built a system that respected popular opinion and majority rule while trying to build guardrails to check popular passion and prejudice. The crimes of the constitutional order are by now well known. It acquiesced to the existence of slavery and prolonged that institution for nearly another century. Early democratic systems enfranchised only a small share of adult Americans. But the genius of the Constitution was in its attempt to move toward democracy while trying to prevent undue concentrations of power. The founders divided power among the branches. They built in a whole series of republican checks, so that demagogues and populist crazes would not sweep over the land.<br>
因此，国父们建立起一个尊重民意、采行多数统治原则的体系，同时试图建造护栏来遏制民众的激情和偏见。这个宪政秩序的罪行如今已广为人知。它默许了奴隶制的存在，并让这一制度延长了近一个世纪。早期的民主制度只赋予了一小部分美国成年人选举权。但美国宪法的天才之处在于，它试图走向民主的同时，也试图防止权力过度集中。国父们将权力分配给不同机构。他们建立了一系列的共和制约，使得煽动者和民粹主义的狂热不会席卷整个国家。</p>
<p>“They designed a constitution for fallen people,” the historian Robert Tracy McKenzie writes in his book “We the Fallen People.” “Its genius lay in how it held in tension two seemingly incompatible beliefs: first, that the majority must generally prevail; and second, that the majority is predisposed to seek personal advantage above the common good.”<br>
“他们为堕落的人设计了一部宪法，”历史学家罗伯特·特雷西·麦肯齐《我们是堕落的人民》(We the Fallen People)一书中写道。“宪法的天才之处在于，它如何将两个看似不相容的信念矛盾地统一起来：第一个是，大多数人必须通常占上风；第二个是，大多数人容易将个人利益置于共同利益之上。”</p>
<p>While the Constitution guarded against abuses of power, the founders recognized that a much more important set of civic practices would mold people to be capable of being self-governing citizens: Churches were meant to teach virtue; leaders were to receive classical education, so they might understand human virtue and vice and the fragility of democracy; everyday citizens were to lead their lives as yeoman farmers so they might learn to live simply and work hard; civic associations and local government were to instill the habits of public service; patriotic rituals were observed to instill shared love of country; newspapers and magazines were there (more in theory than in fact) to create a well-informed citizenry; etiquette rules and democratic manners were adopted to encourage social equality and mutual respect.<br>
虽然宪法防范了权力滥用，但开国元勋们认识到，是一套更为重要的公民实践将人民塑造成有自治能力的公民：教会应该传授美德；领导者要接受古典教育，这样他们就有可能懂得人类的美德和邪恶，以及民主制度的脆弱；普通公民要像自耕农那样生活，这样他们就可能学会简单生活和努力工作；公民社团和地方政府要逐步培养人们公共服务的习惯；爱国仪式的庆祝会逐步培养人们对国家的共同热爱；报纸和杂志的存在（更多在理论上，而非事实上）是为了产生一个有见识的公民群体；采用礼仪规矩和民主行为方式是为了促进社会平等和相互尊重。</p>
<p>Think of it like farming. Planting the seeds is like establishing a democracy. But for democracy to function you have to till and fertilize the soil, erect fences, pull up weeds, prune the early growth. The founders knew that democracy is not natural. It takes a lot of cultivation to make democracy work.<br>
民主实践有点像务农。建立民主制度像是播下种子。但要让民主制度正常工作，你需要耕作，给土壤施肥，竖起篱笆，拔除杂草，修剪早枝。开国元勋们知道民主制度不是天生的。需要大量耕耘，才能让民主制度发挥作用。</p>
<p>American foreign policy had a second founding after World War II. For much of our history Americans were content to prosper behind the safety of the oceans. But after having been dragged into two world wars, a generation of Americans realized the old attitude wasn’t working any more and America, following the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would have to help build a liberal world order if it was to remain secure.<br>
第二次世界大战后，美国的外交政策得到了第二次创建。在我们历史上的大部分时间里，美国人曾满足于在大洋保护下的繁荣兴旺。但被迫卷入两次世界大战之后，一代美国人意识到，以前的态度不再可行，在富兰克林·罗斯福和哈里·杜鲁门领导下的美国，如果想保持一个安全环境，就必须帮助建立一个自由的世界秩序。</p>
<p>The postwar generation was a bit like the founding generation. Its leaders — from Truman to George F. Kennan to Reinhold Niebuhr — championed democracy, but they had no illusions about the depravity of human beings. They’d read their history and understood that stretching back thousands of years, war, authoritarianism, exploitation, great powers crushing little ones — these were just the natural state of human societies.<br>
“二战”后的一代有点像建国的那代。这代人中的领袖——从杜鲁门到乔治·凯南再到赖因霍尔德·尼布尔——为民主而斗争，但他们深知人类的堕落。他们读过人类的历史，知道上溯几千年，人类社会的自然状态是战争、专制、剥削、大国制伏小国。</p>
<p>If America was to be secure, Americans would have to plant the seeds of democracy, but also do all the work of cultivation so those seeds could flourish. Americans oversaw the creation of peaceful democracies from the ruins of military dictatorships in Germany and Japan. They funded the Marshall Plan. They helped build multinational institutions like NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund.<br>
如果美国想有安全的话，美国人就必须在全世界播下民主的种子，但同时也要做所有的耕耘，让这些种子茁壮成长。在美国人的监督下，德国和日本在军事独裁的废墟上建起了和平的民主制度。美国人为马歇尔计划提供了资金。他们帮助建立了北约、世界银行、国际货币基金组织等多国机构。</p>
<p>American military might stood ready to push back against the wolves who threatened the world order — sometimes effectively, as in Europe, but oftentimes, as in Vietnam and Iraq, recklessly and self-destructively. America championed democracy and human rights, at least when the Communists were violating them (not so much when our dictator allies across, say, Latin America were).<br>
美国的军事力量随时准备着抵制威胁世界秩序的恶狼，这种做法有时有效，比如在欧洲，但常常不计后果，导致自毁的结局，比如在越南和伊拉克。美国为民主和人权而斗争，至少在共产党人侵犯民主和人权时这样做（但当我们的独裁者盟友——比如拉丁美洲的那些——侵犯民主和人权时，就不太管了）。</p>
<p>Just as America’s founders understood that democracy is not natural, the postwar generation understood that peace is not natural — it has to be tended and cultivated from the frailties of human passion and greed.<br>
正如美国的开国元勋们懂得民主不是天生的一样，战后的一代也懂得和平不是天生的，和平需要呵护培育，以免人类激情和贪婪的弱点让其毁于一旦。</p>
<p>Over the past few generations that hopeful but sober view of human nature has faded. What’s been called the Culture of Narcissism took hold, with the view that human beings should be unshackled from restraint. You can trust yourself to be unselfish! Democracy and world peace were taken for granted. As Robert Kagan put it in his book “The Jungle Grows Back”: “We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable.”<br>
在过去几代人的时间里，这种对人性充满希望但又清醒的认识已经消失。一种被称为“自我陶醉的文化”开始盛行，认为人类应该不受任何约束力的束缚。你可以相信自己是无私的！民主制度和世界和平被认为是理所当然的东西。正如罗伯特·卡根在他的《丛林重新长起》(The Jungle Grows Back)一书中所言：“我们在自由秩序的泡泡中生活了太久，以至于我们无法想象其他类型的世界。我们认为这是天然的、正常的，甚至是不可避免的。”</p>
<p>If people are naturally good, we no longer have to do the hard agricultural work of cultivating virtuous citizens or fighting against human frailty. The Western advisers I covered in Russia in the early 1990s thought a lot about privatization and market reforms and very little about how to prevent greedy monsters from stealing the whole country. They had a naïve view of human nature.<br>
如果人性本善的话，我们就不需再为培养善良的公民进行艰苦的耕耘，或与人类的弱点作斗争。上世纪90年代初，我在俄罗斯采访过的那些西方顾问们对私有化和市场改革有很多想法，却很少思考如何防止贪婪的恶棍将整个国家的财富偷走的问题。他们对人性有一种幼稚的看法。</p>
<p>Even in America, over the past decades, the institutions that earlier generations thought were essential to molding a democratic citizenry have withered or malfunctioned. Many churches and media outlets have gone partisan. Civics education has receded. Neighborhood organizations have shrunk. Patriotic rituals are out of fashion.<br>
就连在美国，在过去的几十年里，前几代人认为对塑造民主公民至关重要的制度也已经枯萎或失灵。许多教会和媒体机构已经开始偏向党派。公民教育已逐渐减弱。社区组织已经萎缩。爱国仪式已经过时。</p>
<p>What happens when you don’t tend the seedbeds of democracy? Chaos? War? No, you return to normal. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were normal. Big countries like China, Russia and Turkey are ruled by fierce leaders with massive power. That’s normal. Small aristocracies in many nations hog gigantic shares of their nations’ wealth. That’s normal. Many people come to despise cultural outsiders, like immigrants. Normal. Global affairs resembles the law of the jungle, with big countries threatening small ones. This is the way it’s been for most of human history.<br>
如果你不去照料民主的苗床，会发生什么？混乱？战争？不是，你会回到常态。15、16、17、18世纪的常态。像中国、俄罗斯和土耳其这样的大国，都由权力巨大的凶残领导人统治，那是常态。许多国家的小部分贵族占有国家财富的巨大份额，那是常态。许多人开始鄙视文化外来者，比如移民，那是常态。全球事务类似丛林法则，大国威胁小国。这是人类历史上大部分时间的状态。</p>
<p>In normal times, people crave order and leaders like Vladimir Putin arise to give it to them. Putin and Xi Jinping have arisen to be the 21st century’s paradigmatic men.<br>
在常态时代，人们渴望秩序，出现像弗拉基米尔·普京这样的领导人，给予他们秩序。普京和习近平已作为21世纪的范式人物出现。</p>
<p>Putin has established political order in Russia by reviving the Russian strong state tradition and by concentrating power in the hands of one man. He has established economic order through a grand bargain with oligarch-led firms, with him as the ultimate C.E.O. As Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy write in their book, “Mr. Putin,” corruption is the glue that holds the system together. Everybody’s wealth is deliberately tainted, so Putin has the power to accuse anyone of corruption and remove anyone at any time.<br>
普京通过恢复俄罗斯强大国家的传统，通过将权力集中在一个人手中，在俄罗斯建立了政治秩序。他通过与寡头领导的公司大妥协，建立了经济秩序，当上了有最后决定权的首席执行官。正如菲奥娜·希尔和克利福德·加迪在《普京先生》(Mr. Putin)一书中所写的那样，腐败是将整个经济维系起来的粘合剂。故意让每个人的财富都不干净，这就让普京有指控任何人腐败、随时罢免任何人的权力。</p>
<p>He offers cultural order. He embraces the Russian Orthodox Church and rails against the postmodern godlessness of the West. He scorns homosexuality and transgenderism.<br>
他提供文化秩序。他欣然接受俄罗斯东正教会，抨击西方后现代社会的无神论。他鄙视同性恋和跨性别。</p>
<p>Putin has redefined global conservatism and made himself its global leader. Many conservatives around the world see Putin’s strong, manly authority, his defense of traditional values and his enthusiastic embrace of orthodox faith, and they see their aspirations in human form. Right-wing leaders from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen in France to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines speak of Putin admiringly.<br>
普京重新定义了全球保守主义，并将自己作为其全球领袖。世界各地的许多保守者看到普京强大、阳刚的权威，看到他捍卫传统价值观，看到他热情接受正统信仰，他们看到自己渴望的东西化作了人形。从美国的唐纳德·特朗普到法国的马琳·勒庞，再到菲律宾的罗德里戈·杜特尔特，这些右翼领导人都对普京充满钦佩之情。</p>
<p>The 21st century has become a dark century because the seedbeds of democracy have been neglected and normal historical authoritarianism is on the march. Putin and Xi seem confident that the winds of history are at their back. Writing in The Times a few weeks ago, Hill said that Putin believes the United States is in the same predicament Russia was in during the 1990s — “weakened at home and in retreat abroad.”<br>
21世纪已变成一个黑暗的世纪，因为民主的苗床无人照管，历史上的威权主义常态正在前进。普京和习近平似乎对自己身后是历史的潮流充满信心。希尔几周前在时报撰文写道，普京认为，美国处在与俄罗斯上世纪90年代所处的相同困境——“国内力量减弱，国外节节败退”。</p>
<p>Putin, Xi and the other global conservatives make comprehensive critiques of liberalism and the failings of liberal society. Unlike past authoritarians they have the massive power of modern surveillance technology to control their citizens. Russian troops are on the border of Ukraine because Putin needs to create the kind of disordered world that people like him thrive in. “The problem Russia has faced since the end of the Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be achieved in a world that is secure and stable,” Kagan writes in “The Jungle Grows Back.” “To achieve greatness on the world stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians nor anyone else enjoyed security.”<br>
普京、习近平，以及全球的其他保守者，对自由主义和自由社会的失败展开全面批判。与过去的独裁者不同，他们有强大的现代监控技术来控制其公民。俄罗斯军队在乌克兰边境集结，因为普京需要创造一个他这种人赖以生存的混乱世界。“自冷战结束以来，俄罗斯面临的问题是，普京和许多俄罗斯人所追求的那种伟大无法在一个安全稳定的世界中实现，”卡根在《丛林重新长起》一书中写道。“为了在世界舞台上一个有伟大地位，俄罗斯必须把世界带回到过去，带回到无论是俄罗斯人还是其他任何人都不享有安全的时代。”</p>
<p>Will the liberals of the world be able to hold off the wolves? Strengthen democracy and preserve the rules-based world order? The events of the past few weeks have been fortifying. Joe Biden and the other world leaders have done an impressive job of rallying their collective resolve and pushing to keep Putin within his borders. But the problems of democracy and the liberal order can’t be solved from the top down. Today, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, “endless wars” and domination. They don’t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it.<br>
全世界自由主义者能够抵挡住这些恶狼吗？能够加强民主制度、维护以规则为基础的世界秩序吗？过去几周发生的事情已增强了人们的信心。乔·拜登和其他世界领导人在凝聚共同的决心、努力让普京不越过他的边界方面做得非常出色。但是，不能用从上到下的办法解决民主制度和自由秩序的问题。今天，跨越从左到右政治派别的几百万美国人，把美国在海外的努力视为类似帝国主义、“无休止的战争”和主宰世界的事情。他们不相信战后计划，拒绝为这种计划提供选民支持。</p>
<p>The real problem is in the seedbeds of democracy, the institutions that are supposed to mold a citizenry and make us qualified to practice democracy. To restore those seedbeds, we first have to relearn the wisdom of the founders: We are not as virtuous as we think we are. Americans are no better than anyone else. Democracy is not natural; it is an artificial accomplishment that takes enormous work.<br>
真正的问题在于民主制度的苗床，在于那些本该塑造公民、让我们成为合格民主实践者的制度。要让这些苗床恢复健康，我们首先要重新学习建国元勋们的智慧：我们不像我们自己认为的那样有道德。美国人并不好于任何人。民主制度不是天生的；民主制度是需要付出巨大努力的人工构建。</p>
<p>Then we need to fortify the institutions that are supposed to teach the democratic skills: how to weigh evidence and commit to truth; how to correct for your own partisan blinders and learn to doubt your own opinions; how to respect people you disagree with; how to avoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking; how to avoid supporting demagogues; how to craft complex compromises.<br>
再有，我们需要加强本应传授民主技能的机构：如何慎重考虑证据，坚持事实；如何纠正自己的党派偏见，学会怀疑自己的观点；如何尊重与你意见相左的人；如何避免祸患论、阴谋论和末日论思维；如何避免支持蛊惑民心的政客；如何达成复杂的妥协方案。</p>
<p>Democrats are not born; they are made. If the 21st century is to get brighter as it goes along, we have to get a lot better at making them. We don’t only have to worry about the people tearing down democracy. We have to worry about who is building it up.<br>
民主实践者不是天生的，而是培养出来的。如果要让21世纪的未来变得越来越光明的话，我们必须在这方面做更多的努力。我们不仅要担心那些要摧毁民主制度的人。我们也必须关心那些将把这个制度变得更强的人。</p>
