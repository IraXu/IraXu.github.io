Putin of Russia ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. 华盛顿——周四，在俄罗斯总统普京下令军队入侵乌克兰之后，世界上很多人一觉醒来，便被欧洲爆发全面战争的恐惧所笼罩。 That left millions of people — in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, but also in the United States and elsewhere — wondering how the conflict would affect their lives. 在乌克兰和东欧，以及在美国和其他地方，无数人想知道这场冲突将对他们的生活造成怎样的影响。 At least 40 Ukrainian solders were reported killed in the hours after the invasion, with estimates of tens of thousands of deaths over the course of the conflict. 据报道，在入侵后的几个小时内，至少有40名乌克兰士兵死亡，估计在冲突期间会有数万人死亡。 But beyond the anticipated bloodshed, economic penalties to punish Russia will reverberate worldwide. 但是，除了预期中的流血冲突之外，对俄罗斯的经济制裁将在全世界产生影响。 Rising energy costs and potentially slowing supply chains will take their toll on consumers. Russian cyberattacks could cripple electronic infrastructure. 不断上涨的能源成本和可能的供应链放缓将对消费者造成影响。俄罗斯的网络攻击可能使电子基础设施瘫痪。 A new refugee crisis will require international assistance. And an era of relative calm in the West that has pervaded since the end of the Cold War might be coming to a close. 一场新的难民危机将需要国际援助。西方自冷战结束以来相对平静的时代可能即将结束。 Here is what might happen next on the military, economic and diplomatic fronts. 以下是接下来军事、经济和外交方面可能发生的情况。 More military forces head to NATO's eastern borders更多军力前往北约东部边境 NATO announced on Thursday that it was sending reinforcements to its eastern flank, joining some 6,500 U.S. troops the Pentagon has already dispatched to Eastern Europe and the Baltics. 北约周四宣布，它正在向其东翼派遣增援部队，另外五角大楼已经向东欧和波罗的海地区派遣了大约6500名美军。 “We are deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the alliance, as well as additional maritime assets,” NATO said in a statement. “We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.” “我们正在联盟东部部署更多的防御性陆地和空军力量，以及更多的海上资产，”北约在声明中表示。“我们已经提高了部队应对所有突发事件的准备。” The Pentagon is also repositioning about 1,000 troops in Europe. About 800 U.S. troops are moving to the Baltics from Italy; 20 Apache helicopters are heading to the Baltics from Germany, and 12 Apaches are going to Poland from Greece. Eight F-35 strike fighters are heading to Lithuania, Estonia and Romania from Germany, the Pentagon said. 五角大楼还在重新部署欧洲的约1000名士兵。大约800名美军正从意大利向波罗的海转移；20架阿帕奇直升机正从德国调往波罗的海，12架阿帕奇直升机从希腊调往波兰。五角大楼表示，八架F-35战斗机正从德国飞往立陶宛、爱沙尼亚和罗马尼亚。 In addition, U.S. Army troops, including those from the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions, are preparing to move closer to Poland’s border with Ukraine to help process people fleeing the country, an Army spokesman said on Thursday. 此外，美国陆军发言人周四表示，包括第82和101空降师在内的美国陆军部队正准备向波兰与乌克兰边境靠近，以帮助处理逃离该国的人。 Many of the 5,500 troops from the 18th Airborne Corps who arrived in Poland this month have been working with the State Department and Polish forces to set up three processing centers near the border to help deal with tens of thousands of people, including Americans, who are expected to flee Ukraine. 本月抵达波兰的第18空降军团的5500名士兵中的许多人一直在与美国国务院和波兰部队合作，在边境附近建立三个处理中心，帮助处理包括美国人在内的数万名预计将逃离乌克兰的民众。 In Jasionka, Poland, an indoor arena has been outfitted with bunk beds and supplies for up to 500 people; U.S. officials say that capacity could be quickly expanded. 在波兰的亚西翁卡，一个室内体育场已配备了双层床和各种用品，可以容纳500人；美国官员说，这一容量可以迅速扩大。 In Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Wednesday that he was prepared to accept refugees. 奥地利总理卡尔·内哈默周三表示，他准备接受难民。 The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development are funding relief organizations that are currently providing food, water, shelter and emergency health care to people in the region who have fled to escape the violence. 美国国务院和美国国际开发署正在为救援组织提供资金，这些组织目前正在为该地区逃离暴力的人们提供食物、水、住所和紧急医疗服务。 In the days to come, the C.I.A. will assess what kind of assistance it can provide to Ukraine. If a Ukrainian resistance develops in parts of the country that Russia seeks to control, the agency could secretly supply partisan forces with intelligence and, potentially, armaments. 未来几天，中情局将就援助乌克兰进行评估。如果乌克兰的抵抗运动在俄罗斯试图控制的地区发展起来，该机构可以向游击队秘密提供情报，并有可能提供武器。 “We need to support the resistance to the invasion and the occupation in all ways possible,” said Mick Mulroy, a former C.I.A. paramilitary officer and senior Pentagon official in the Trump administration. “Our special operations and intelligence assets with an extensive knowledge base from 20 years of fighting insurgencies should be put to immediate use.” “我们需要以一切可能的方式支持对入侵和占领的抵抗，”前中情局准军事行动人员、特朗普政府的五角大楼高级官员米克·马尔罗伊说。“我们的特种作战和情报资产拥有20年打击叛乱分子的巨大知识储备，应该立即投入使用。” ‘Severe’ sanctions from the U.S. and Europe来自美国和欧洲的“严厉”制裁 President Biden on Thursday plans to announce “severe sanctions” against Russia to try to deter Moscow from carrying out further violence in Ukraine and to punish it for its actions, U.S. officials said. 美国官员说，拜登总统周四计划宣布对俄罗斯实施“严厉制裁”，以阻止莫斯科在乌克兰采取进一步的暴力行动，并对其行为进行惩罚。 The next set of economic sanctions is expected to be much harsher than what U.S. officials had described as a first tranche that was imposed on Monday and Tuesday. 新的经济制裁措施预计将比美国官员所说的周一和周二实施的第一批制裁严厉得多。 Mr. Biden is likely to order the Treasury Department to put one or more large Russian state-owned banks on the agency’s list for the harshest sanctions, known as the S.D.N. list. 拜登可能会命令财政部将一家或多家俄罗斯大型国有银行列入该机构最严厉的制裁名单，也就是所谓的SDN名单。 That would cut off the banks from commerce and exchanges with much of the world and affect many other Russian business operations. 这将切断这些银行与世界大部分地区的商业和交流，并影响俄罗斯其他许多商业活动。 The Biden administration said on Tuesday that it was imposing that kind of sanctions on two banks, VEB and PSB, but those are policy banks with no retail operations in Russia. 拜登政府周二表示，将对俄罗斯对外经济银行和俄罗斯工业通讯银行这两家银行实施此类制裁，但这两家银行是在俄罗斯没有零售业务的政策性银行。 Administration officials have studied how sanctions would affect each of the big banks, including Sberbank and VTB, Russia’s two largest banks. 政府官员对制裁将如何影响俄罗斯所有大银行进行了研究，包括该国最大的两家银行俄罗斯储蓄银行和俄罗斯外贸银行。 Sberbank has about a third of the assets in the country’s banking sector, and VTB has more than 15 percent. Some experts are skeptical that the administration would put those two banks on the S.D.N. list for fear of the consequences for the Russian and global economies. 俄罗斯储蓄银行拥有该国银行业约三分之一的资产，俄罗斯外贸银行拥有超过15%的资产。一些专家对政府是否会将这两家银行列入SDN名单持怀疑态度，因为政府可能对此举将给俄罗斯和全球经济造成的影响感到担心。 For now, U.S. officials are not ready to cut off all Russian banks from Swift, the important Belgian money transfer system used by more than 11,000 financial institutions worldwide. 目前，美国官员还没有准备好切断所有俄罗斯银行与Swift的联系。Swift是比利时重要的汇款系统，被全球1.1万多家金融机构使用。 The Treasury Department has other sanctions lists that would impose costs while inflicting less widespread suffering. For example, it could put a bank on a list that prevents it from doing any transactions involving dollars. Many international commercial transactions are done in U.S. dollars, the currency that underpins the global economy. 财政部还列出了其他制裁名单，这些名单在给俄罗斯造成损失的同时带来的痛苦相对会较小。例如，它可以将一家俄罗斯银行列入禁止其进行任何涉美元交易的名单。许多国际商业交易都是用美元这一支撑全球经济的货币进行的。 The Treasury Department is also expected to put more Russian officials, businesspeople and companies on the sanctions lists. 预计美国财政部还将把更多俄罗斯官员、商人和公司列入制裁名单。 By Thursday afternoon in Russia, the nation’s stock market had fallen nearly 40 percent. 截至周四下午，俄罗斯股市下跌了近40%。 The Commerce Department has been making plans to restrict the export of certain American technologies to Russia, a tactic that the Trump administration used to hobble Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. 商务部一直在制定计划，限制向俄罗斯出口某些美国技术，特朗普政府曾用这种策略打压中国的电信企业华为。 The controls would damage the supply chain for some Russian sectors. U.S. officials said their targets included the defense industry and the oil and gas industry. 这些管制措施将损害俄罗斯一些行业的供应链。美国官员说，他们的目标包括国防工业以及石油和天然气行业。 European officials are expected to announce sanctions similar to many of the ones planned by the United States, as they did this week. However, they have been more wary of imposing the harshest sanctions because of the continent’s robust trade with Russia. 预计欧洲官员将宣布与美国在本周计划的许多制裁类似的举措。但是，由于欧洲与俄罗斯的贸易往来更为频繁，他们对实施最严厉的制裁会持更加谨慎的态度。 Although Mr. Biden has said he will contemplate any possible sanctions, U.S. officials for now do not plan big disruptions to Russia’s energy exports, which are the pillar of the country’s economy. Europe relies on the products, and surging oil prices worldwide would cause greater inflation and more problems for politicians. 虽然拜登表示他将考虑任何可能的制裁，但美国官员目前还不打算对作为俄罗斯经济支柱的能源出口作出重大破坏。欧洲依赖这些产品，并且全球油价飙升会导致更严重的通胀以及给政客带来更多问题。 However, Germany announces this week that it would not certify Nord Stream 2, a new natural gas pipeline that connects Russia and Western Europe. On Wednesday Mr. Biden announced sanctions on a subsidiary of Gazprom, the large Russian energy company, which built the pipeline and had planned to operate it. 然而，德国本周宣布不会对连接俄罗斯和西欧的新天然气管道“北溪2号”进行认证。周三，拜登宣布对俄罗斯大型能源公司俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司的一家子公司实施制裁，这条管道由该公司建造和计划运营。 “We have been frank, we have been candid with the American people that our measures — the measures we have and are prepared to impose on the Russian Federation — certainly won’t be cost-free for the Russian Federation,” Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday. “But they won’t be entirely cost-free for the rest of the world as well.” “我们对美国人民开诚布公，我们的措施——我们对俄罗斯联邦已经实施以及准备实施的措施——对俄罗斯联邦来说肯定不会是没有代价的，”美国国务院发言人内德·普赖斯周三表示。“但对于世界其他地区来说，它们也不会完全没有代价。” Even so, new economic burdens come at a difficult moment for Mr. Biden, who is grappling with voter frustration over inflation less than nine months before the midterm elections. 即便如此，对于拜登来说，新的经济负担降临在一个艰难的时刻，距离中期选举还有不到九个月的时间，他正在努力应对选民对通胀的不满。 Republicans are expected to seize on additional domestic economic hardships to criticize Mr. Biden and Democrats. A strong faction of the Republican Party — led by President Donald J. Trump that includes the Fox News host Tucker Carlson — has been praising Russia, downplaying the importance of defending Ukraine and criticizing Mr. Biden for many policies. Some analysts say Mr. Putin sees such political division as a strategic advantage. 预计共和党人将利用更多的国内经济困难来批评拜登和民主党人。共和党的一个强大派系——由特朗普总统领导，包括福克斯新闻主持人塔克·卡尔森——一直在赞扬俄罗斯，淡化保卫乌克兰的重要性，并批评拜登的许多政策。一些分析人士说，普京将这种政治分歧视为一种战略优势。 Diplomacy in turmoil with Russia's ‘path of aggression’外交因俄罗斯走上“侵略之路”而陷入混乱 The State Department has moved its personnel to Poland from Ukraine, as diplomats continue to help the government in Kyiv and offer consular assistance to American citizens who want to leave Ukraine. Mr. Price estimated on Wednesday that far fewer Americans were in Ukraine than the 6,600 who were believed to be in the country in the fall. 国务院已将在乌克兰的员工转移到波兰，外交官继续帮助基辅的乌克兰政府，并为想要离开乌克兰的美国公民提供领事协助。据信去年秋季有6600名美国人在乌克兰，普莱斯周三估计现在的人数已大大降低。 The larger question for the rest of the world is whether Mr. Putin’s invasion has irrevocably broken international systems in which Russia has been seen as a legitimate contributor. 对世界其他国家来说，更大的问题是普京的入侵是否已经不可逆转地破坏了国际体系，在这一体系中，俄罗斯被视为合法促进者。 “Last night’s events are a turning point in the history of Europe and of our country,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said in an address on Thursday morning. “They will have lasting, profound consequences for our lives.” “昨晚的事件是欧洲历史和我国历史的转折点，”法国总统马克龙在周四上午的讲话中说。“它们将对我们的生活产生持久而深远的影响。” Diplomats representing the Group of 7 of the world’s largest industrial nations, NATO, the U.N. Security Council and the European Council were set to meet later on Thursday to plot out the next steps. 代表世界上最大的七个工业国、北约、联合国安理会和欧洲理事会的外交官定于周四晚些时候举行会议，制定下一步行动。 At the Security Council, the United States urged others to join a resolution condemning Russia’s aggressions and defending Ukraine’s sovereignty. The effort, which will be put to a vote on Friday, also calls for humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees and access for relief workers. 在安理会，美国敦促其他国家加入一项谴责俄罗斯侵略和捍卫乌克兰主权的决议。这项工作将于周五进行投票，决议还呼吁向乌克兰难民提供人道主义援助，并允许救援人员进入。 But Russia has a permanent veto on the council, meaning it could derail any resolution the body proposes to rein in Mr. Putin. 但俄罗斯在安理会拥有常任理事国的否决权，意味着它可以破坏安理会提出的任何牵制普京的决议。 Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken may travel to Europe next week to meet allies and ensure that a unified front against Russia remains. He canceled a meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, that had been scheduled for Thursday in Geneva, describing it as unproductive as Russian troops took up battle formations. 国务卿安东尼·布林肯可能会在下周前往欧洲与盟国会面，并确保维持对俄罗斯的统一战线。他取消了原定于周四在日内瓦与俄罗斯外交部长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫的会面，称由于俄罗斯军队已经出动，碰面徒劳无益。 On Wednesday night, even as he predicted that an assault was imminent, Mr. Blinken issued an 11th-hour appeal for Mr. Putin to take a diplomatic path from conflict. 周三晚上，尽管布林肯预测攻击迫在眉睫，但他在最后一刻发出呼吁，要求普京选择外交途径解决冲突。 “If Russia demonstrates that it’s actually serious about that, which unfortunately it’s doing just the opposite, we’ll certainly pursue that,” Mr. Blinken said on ABC News. “But we’ve said all along that we’re prepared for this either way. We’re prepared to try to avert this diplomatically, through dialogue. We’re also prepared if Russia decides to choose the path of aggression.” “如果俄罗斯证明它真的想要解决冲突——不幸的是它所做的事情正相反——我们肯定会朝这个方向努力，”布林肯在美国广播公司新闻上说。“但我们一直都在说，无论哪种方式，我们都为此做好了准备。我们准备尝试通过对话以外交方式避免这种情况。如果俄罗斯决定选择侵略的道路，我们也做好了准备。” It was not immediately clear whether that path had been closed with the invasion. 目前尚不清楚外交途径是否因入侵而关闭。 作者：Lara Jakes、Eric Schmitt、黄安伟 Julian E.

Both China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have appealed to nostalgia for a glorious imperial past to justify their present-day territorial claims. Mr. Xi has intensified his warnings to Taiwan not to seek independence from China, just as Mr. Putin has barraged Ukraine with threats and demands. 虽然这种比较并不完全合适，但台湾和乌克兰一样，长期生活在一个庞大、霸道邻居的阴影下。中国领导人习近平和俄罗斯总统普京都诉诸帝国曾经的辉煌，为他们今天的领土主张辩护。正如普京向乌克兰接二连三发出威胁和要求一样，习近平也加大警告台湾，不要从中国独立。 “We empathize with Ukraine’s situation,” Ms. Tsai said late last month in announcing the creation of a task force to study the tensions in Ukraine. 蔡英文在上个月底宣布成立一个工作组研究乌克兰的紧张局势时说：“我们对于乌克兰的处境感同身受。” During a meeting with the task force on Wednesday, Ms. Tsai condemned Russia for “encroaching on Ukraine’s sovereignty.” She noted, however, that Taiwan was fundamentally different from Ukraine in its geopolitical, economic and geographical conditions. 在周三与该工作组的会议中，蔡英文谴责俄罗斯“侵犯乌克兰的主权”。然而，她指出，台湾在地缘政治、经济和地理条件上与乌克兰有着根本的不同。 She called on her government to remain on high alert against what she described as “cognitive warfare” and disinformation efforts by foreign powers intent on using the tensions in Ukraine to stoke panic and instability in Taiwan. 她呼吁她的政府针对她所说的“认知战”，以及外国势力企图利用乌克兰紧张局势在台湾引发恐慌和不稳定的虚假信息努力保持高度警惕。 While Beijing now regularly sends warplanes toward Taiwan, there is no sign that an invasion of the island is imminent. Rather, the concern among some analysts in Taiwan is that a distracted West or a weak response to a Russian invasion in Ukraine could embolden the ruling Chinese Communist Party to ramp up pressure on the island. 虽然北京现在定期向台湾出动战机，但没有迹象表明即将入侵台湾。相反，台湾一些分析人士担心的是，如果西方的注意力被分散，或对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的反应不力，可能会使执政的中共更加肆无忌惮地加大对该岛的施压。 Others have pointed to the tensions in Ukraine to criticize Ms. Tsai, who has kept a distance from Beijing while simultaneously bolstering ties with the United States and other Western countries. 还有人则以乌克兰的紧张局势来批评蔡英文。她在与北京保持距离的同时，加强了与美国和其他西方国家的关系。 “The Ukraine outcome is right before our eyes,” Chao Chien-min, former deputy minister of Taiwan’s mainland affairs council, said at a conference on Tuesday, according to local news media reports. “Resisting China does not help protect Taiwan — it only accelerates our death.” “乌克兰的结果就在眼前，”据当地新闻媒体报道，台湾大陆委员会前副主委赵建民周二在一次会议上说。“抗中不可能保台，只会死得更快。” Beijing has sought to maintain a balancing act on Ukraine, calling for respect for nations’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also implicitly acknowledging Mr. Putin’s grievances. 北京试图在乌克兰问题上保持中立，呼吁尊重各国主权和领土完整，同时也含蓄地认同普京的不满。 It has made clear, however, that it sees Taiwan, which most countries do not recognize as a sovereign nation, as fundamentally different from Ukraine. 然而，它也明确表示，它认为台湾与乌克兰有着本质的不同。大多数国家不承认台湾为主权国家。 “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affairs,” Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a press briefing on Wednesday. 中国国台办发言人马晓光在周三的新闻发布会上说：“台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾问题纯属中国内政。” Amy Chang Chien contributed reporting.

Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East. 在20世纪90年代初，我是《华尔街日报》驻欧洲的一名机动记者。有那么几年，我感觉自己报道的全是好消息：苏联解体、乌克兰人投票支持独立、两德统一、民主在东欧的展开、曼德拉出狱和种族隔离制度的终结、奥斯陆和平进程似乎给中东带来了稳定。 I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order, democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations from within. 我现在很怀念那些年。之所以这么说，是因为好时光没有持续下来。历史正在向野蛮倒退。我们看到的是：俄罗斯的威权强人威胁要入侵邻国；越来越威权主义的中国对人民发起种族灭绝，对台湾发起威胁；网络攻击正在破坏世界秩序；民主在全球范围内节节败退；西方的暴力民粹主义者正在从内部破坏国家。 What the hell happened? Why were the hopes of the 1990s not realized? What is the key factor that has made the 21st century so dark, regressive and dangerous? 究竟发生了什么？为什么上世纪90年代的希望没能实现？究竟是什么让21世纪变得如此黑暗、退步和危险？ The normal thing to say is that the liberal world order is in crisis. But just saying that doesn’t explain why. Why are people rejecting liberalism? What weakness in liberalism are its enemies exploiting? What is at the root of this dark century? Let me offer one explanation. 一般的说法是，自由主义的世界秩序正身陷危机。但仅仅这么说无法解释个中原因。为什么人们会反对自由主义？自由主义的敌人在利用自由主义的什么弱点？这个黑暗世纪的根源是什么？让我来给一个解释。 Liberalism is a way of life built on respect for the dignity of each individual. A liberal order, John Stuart Mill suggested, is one in which people are free to conduct “experiments in living” so you wind up with “a large variety in types of character.” There’s no one best way to live, so liberals celebrate freedom, personal growth and diversity. 作为一种生活方式，自由主义建立在尊重每个人的尊严之上。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒认为，自由主义秩序是人们可以自由地进行“生活实验”，所以最终会存在“各种各样的性格类型”。没有一种最好的生活方式，所以自由主义者庆祝自由、个人成长和多样性。 Many of America’s founders were fervent believers in liberal democracy — up to a point. They had a profound respect for individual virtue, but also individual frailty. Samuel Adams said, “Ambitions and lust for power … are predominant passions in the breasts of most men.” Patrick Henry admitted to feelings of dread when he contemplated the “depravity of human nature.” One delegate to the constitutional convention said that the people “lack information and are constantly liable to be misled.” 在一定程度上，许多美国的开国元勋都是自由民主的狂热信徒。他们极为尊重个人美德，但也非常尊重个体身上的弱点。塞缪尔·亚当斯说过：“对权力的野心和欲望……是大多数男人心中普遍存在的激情。”帕特里克·亨利承认，当他在思考“人性的堕落”时，会心生恐惧。一名参加制宪会议的代表说，人民“缺乏信息，总是容易被误导”。 Our founders were aware that majorities are easily led by ambitious demagogues. 我们的开国元勋们意识到，大多数人很容易被野心勃勃的煽动家所怂恿。 So our founders built a system that respected popular opinion and majority rule while trying to build guardrails to check popular passion and prejudice. The crimes of the constitutional order are by now well known. It acquiesced to the existence of slavery and prolonged that institution for nearly another century. Early democratic systems enfranchised only a small share of adult Americans. But the genius of the Constitution was in its attempt to move toward democracy while trying to prevent undue concentrations of power. The founders divided power among the branches. They built in a whole series of republican checks, so that demagogues and populist crazes would not sweep over the land. 因此，国父们建立起一个尊重民意、采行多数统治原则的体系，同时试图建造护栏来遏制民众的激情和偏见。这个宪政秩序的罪行如今已广为人知。它默许了奴隶制的存在，并让这一制度延长了近一个世纪。早期的民主制度只赋予了一小部分美国成年人选举权。但美国宪法的天才之处在于，它试图走向民主的同时，也试图防止权力过度集中。国父们将权力分配给不同机构。他们建立了一系列的共和制约，使得煽动者和民粹主义的狂热不会席卷整个国家。 “They designed a constitution for fallen people,” the historian Robert Tracy McKenzie writes in his book “We the Fallen People.” “Its genius lay in how it held in tension two seemingly incompatible beliefs: first, that the majority must generally prevail; and second, that the majority is predisposed to seek personal advantage above the common good.” “他们为堕落的人设计了一部宪法，”历史学家罗伯特·特雷西·麦肯齐《我们是堕落的人民》(We the Fallen People)一书中写道。“宪法的天才之处在于，它如何将两个看似不相容的信念矛盾地统一起来：第一个是，大多数人必须通常占上风；第二个是，大多数人容易将个人利益置于共同利益之上。” While the Constitution guarded against abuses of power, the founders recognized that a much more important set of civic practices would mold people to be capable of being self-governing citizens: Churches were meant to teach virtue; leaders were to receive classical education, so they might understand human virtue and vice and the fragility of democracy; everyday citizens were to lead their lives as yeoman farmers so they might learn to live simply and work hard; civic associations and local government were to instill the habits of public service; patriotic rituals were observed to instill shared love of country; newspapers and magazines were there (more in theory than in fact) to create a well-informed citizenry; etiquette rules and democratic manners were adopted to encourage social equality and mutual respect. 虽然宪法防范了权力滥用，但开国元勋们认识到，是一套更为重要的公民实践将人民塑造成有自治能力的公民：教会应该传授美德；领导者要接受古典教育，这样他们就有可能懂得人类的美德和邪恶，以及民主制度的脆弱；普通公民要像自耕农那样生活，这样他们就可能学会简单生活和努力工作；公民社团和地方政府要逐步培养人们公共服务的习惯；爱国仪式的庆祝会逐步培养人们对国家的共同热爱；报纸和杂志的存在（更多在理论上，而非事实上）是为了产生一个有见识的公民群体；采用礼仪规矩和民主行为方式是为了促进社会平等和相互尊重。 Think of it like farming. Planting the seeds is like establishing a democracy. But for democracy to function you have to till and fertilize the soil, erect fences, pull up weeds, prune the early growth. The founders knew that democracy is not natural. It takes a lot of cultivation to make democracy work. 民主实践有点像务农。建立民主制度像是播下种子。但要让民主制度正常工作，你需要耕作，给土壤施肥，竖起篱笆，拔除杂草，修剪早枝。开国元勋们知道民主制度不是天生的。需要大量耕耘，才能让民主制度发挥作用。 American foreign policy had a second founding after World War II. For much of our history Americans were content to prosper behind the safety of the oceans. But after having been dragged into two world wars, a generation of Americans realized the old attitude wasn’t working any more and America, following the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, would have to help build a liberal world order if it was to remain secure. 第二次世界大战后，美国的外交政策得到了第二次创建。在我们历史上的大部分时间里，美国人曾满足于在大洋保护下的繁荣兴旺。但被迫卷入两次世界大战之后，一代美国人意识到，以前的态度不再可行，在富兰克林·罗斯福和哈里·杜鲁门领导下的美国，如果想保持一个安全环境，就必须帮助建立一个自由的世界秩序。 The postwar generation was a bit like the founding generation. Its leaders — from Truman to George F. Kennan to Reinhold Niebuhr — championed democracy, but they had no illusions about the depravity of human beings. They’d read their history and understood that stretching back thousands of years, war, authoritarianism, exploitation, great powers crushing little ones — these were just the natural state of human societies. “二战”后的一代有点像建国的那代。这代人中的领袖——从杜鲁门到乔治·凯南再到赖因霍尔德·尼布尔——为民主而斗争，但他们深知人类的堕落。他们读过人类的历史，知道上溯几千年，人类社会的自然状态是战争、专制、剥削、大国制伏小国。 If America was to be secure, Americans would have to plant the seeds of democracy, but also do all the work of cultivation so those seeds could flourish. Americans oversaw the creation of peaceful democracies from the ruins of military dictatorships in Germany and Japan. They funded the Marshall Plan. They helped build multinational institutions like NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund. 如果美国想有安全的话，美国人就必须在全世界播下民主的种子，但同时也要做所有的耕耘，让这些种子茁壮成长。在美国人的监督下，德国和日本在军事独裁的废墟上建起了和平的民主制度。美国人为马歇尔计划提供了资金。他们帮助建立了北约、世界银行、国际货币基金组织等多国机构。 American military might stood ready to push back against the wolves who threatened the world order — sometimes effectively, as in Europe, but oftentimes, as in Vietnam and Iraq, recklessly and self-destructively. America championed democracy and human rights, at least when the Communists were violating them (not so much when our dictator allies across, say, Latin America were). 美国的军事力量随时准备着抵制威胁世界秩序的恶狼，这种做法有时有效，比如在欧洲，但常常不计后果，导致自毁的结局，比如在越南和伊拉克。美国为民主和人权而斗争，至少在共产党人侵犯民主和人权时这样做（但当我们的独裁者盟友——比如拉丁美洲的那些——侵犯民主和人权时，就不太管了）。 Just as America’s founders understood that democracy is not natural, the postwar generation understood that peace is not natural — it has to be tended and cultivated from the frailties of human passion and greed. 正如美国的开国元勋们懂得民主不是天生的一样，战后的一代也懂得和平不是天生的，和平需要呵护培育，以免人类激情和贪婪的弱点让其毁于一旦。 Over the past few generations that hopeful but sober view of human nature has faded. What’s been called the Culture of Narcissism took hold, with the view that human beings should be unshackled from restraint. You can trust yourself to be unselfish! Democracy and world peace were taken for granted. As Robert Kagan put it in his book “The Jungle Grows Back”: “We have lived so long inside the bubble of the liberal order that we can imagine no other kind of world. We think it is natural and normal, even inevitable.” 在过去几代人的时间里，这种对人性充满希望但又清醒的认识已经消失。一种被称为“自我陶醉的文化”开始盛行，认为人类应该不受任何约束力的束缚。你可以相信自己是无私的！民主制度和世界和平被认为是理所当然的东西。正如罗伯特·卡根在他的《丛林重新长起》(The Jungle Grows Back)一书中所言：“我们在自由秩序的泡泡中生活了太久，以至于我们无法想象其他类型的世界。我们认为这是天然的、正常的，甚至是不可避免的。” If people are naturally good, we no longer have to do the hard agricultural work of cultivating virtuous citizens or fighting against human frailty. The Western advisers I covered in Russia in the early 1990s thought a lot about privatization and market reforms and very little about how to prevent greedy monsters from stealing the whole country. They had a naïve view of human nature. 如果人性本善的话，我们就不需再为培养善良的公民进行艰苦的耕耘，或与人类的弱点作斗争。上世纪90年代初，我在俄罗斯采访过的那些西方顾问们对私有化和市场改革有很多想法，却很少思考如何防止贪婪的恶棍将整个国家的财富偷走的问题。他们对人性有一种幼稚的看法。 Even in America, over the past decades, the institutions that earlier generations thought were essential to molding a democratic citizenry have withered or malfunctioned. Many churches and media outlets have gone partisan. Civics education has receded. Neighborhood organizations have shrunk. Patriotic rituals are out of fashion. 就连在美国，在过去的几十年里，前几代人认为对塑造民主公民至关重要的制度也已经枯萎或失灵。许多教会和媒体机构已经开始偏向党派。公民教育已逐渐减弱。社区组织已经萎缩。爱国仪式已经过时。 What happens when you don’t tend the seedbeds of democracy? Chaos? War? No, you return to normal. The 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were normal. Big countries like China, Russia and Turkey are ruled by fierce leaders with massive power. That’s normal. Small aristocracies in many nations hog gigantic shares of their nations’ wealth. That’s normal. Many people come to despise cultural outsiders, like immigrants. Normal. Global affairs resembles the law of the jungle, with big countries threatening small ones. This is the way it’s been for most of human history. 如果你不去照料民主的苗床，会发生什么？混乱？战争？不是，你会回到常态。15、16、17、18世纪的常态。像中国、俄罗斯和土耳其这样的大国，都由权力巨大的凶残领导人统治，那是常态。许多国家的小部分贵族占有国家财富的巨大份额，那是常态。许多人开始鄙视文化外来者，比如移民，那是常态。全球事务类似丛林法则，大国威胁小国。这是人类历史上大部分时间的状态。 In normal times, people crave order and leaders like Vladimir Putin arise to give it to them. Putin and Xi Jinping have arisen to be the 21st century’s paradigmatic men. 在常态时代，人们渴望秩序，出现像弗拉基米尔·普京这样的领导人，给予他们秩序。普京和习近平已作为21世纪的范式人物出现。 Putin has established political order in Russia by reviving the Russian strong state tradition and by concentrating power in the hands of one man. He has established economic order through a grand bargain with oligarch-led firms, with him as the ultimate C.E.O. As Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy write in their book, “Mr. Putin,” corruption is the glue that holds the system together. Everybody’s wealth is deliberately tainted, so Putin has the power to accuse anyone of corruption and remove anyone at any time. 普京通过恢复俄罗斯强大国家的传统，通过将权力集中在一个人手中，在俄罗斯建立了政治秩序。他通过与寡头领导的公司大妥协，建立了经济秩序，当上了有最后决定权的首席执行官。正如菲奥娜·希尔和克利福德·加迪在《普京先生》(Mr. Putin)一书中所写的那样，腐败是将整个经济维系起来的粘合剂。故意让每个人的财富都不干净，这就让普京有指控任何人腐败、随时罢免任何人的权力。 He offers cultural order. He embraces the Russian Orthodox Church and rails against the postmodern godlessness of the West. He scorns homosexuality and transgenderism. 他提供文化秩序。他欣然接受俄罗斯东正教会，抨击西方后现代社会的无神论。他鄙视同性恋和跨性别。 Putin has redefined global conservatism and made himself its global leader. Many conservatives around the world see Putin’s strong, manly authority, his defense of traditional values and his enthusiastic embrace of orthodox faith, and they see their aspirations in human form. Right-wing leaders from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen in France to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines speak of Putin admiringly. 普京重新定义了全球保守主义，并将自己作为其全球领袖。世界各地的许多保守者看到普京强大、阳刚的权威，看到他捍卫传统价值观，看到他热情接受正统信仰，他们看到自己渴望的东西化作了人形。从美国的唐纳德·特朗普到法国的马琳·勒庞，再到菲律宾的罗德里戈·杜特尔特，这些右翼领导人都对普京充满钦佩之情。 The 21st century has become a dark century because the seedbeds of democracy have been neglected and normal historical authoritarianism is on the march. Putin and Xi seem confident that the winds of history are at their back. Writing in The Times a few weeks ago, Hill said that Putin believes the United States is in the same predicament Russia was in during the 1990s — “weakened at home and in retreat abroad.” 21世纪已变成一个黑暗的世纪，因为民主的苗床无人照管，历史上的威权主义常态正在前进。普京和习近平似乎对自己身后是历史的潮流充满信心。希尔几周前在时报撰文写道，普京认为，美国处在与俄罗斯上世纪90年代所处的相同困境——“国内力量减弱，国外节节败退”。 Putin, Xi and the other global conservatives make comprehensive critiques of liberalism and the failings of liberal society. Unlike past authoritarians they have the massive power of modern surveillance technology to control their citizens. Russian troops are on the border of Ukraine because Putin needs to create the kind of disordered world that people like him thrive in. “The problem Russia has faced since the end of the Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be achieved in a world that is secure and stable,” Kagan writes in “The Jungle Grows Back.” “To achieve greatness on the world stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians nor anyone else enjoyed security.” 普京、习近平，以及全球的其他保守者，对自由主义和自由社会的失败展开全面批判。与过去的独裁者不同，他们有强大的现代监控技术来控制其公民。俄罗斯军队在乌克兰边境集结，因为普京需要创造一个他这种人赖以生存的混乱世界。“自冷战结束以来，俄罗斯面临的问题是，普京和许多俄罗斯人所追求的那种伟大无法在一个安全稳定的世界中实现，”卡根在《丛林重新长起》一书中写道。“为了在世界舞台上一个有伟大地位，俄罗斯必须把世界带回到过去，带回到无论是俄罗斯人还是其他任何人都不享有安全的时代。” Will the liberals of the world be able to hold off the wolves? Strengthen democracy and preserve the rules-based world order? The events of the past few weeks have been fortifying. Joe Biden and the other world leaders have done an impressive job of rallying their collective resolve and pushing to keep Putin within his borders. But the problems of democracy and the liberal order can’t be solved from the top down. Today, across left and right, millions of Americans see U.S. efforts abroad as little more than imperialism, “endless wars” and domination. They don’t believe in the postwar project and refuse to provide popular support for it. 全世界自由主义者能够抵挡住这些恶狼吗？能够加强民主制度、维护以规则为基础的世界秩序吗？过去几周发生的事情已增强了人们的信心。乔·拜登和其他世界领导人在凝聚共同的决心、努力让普京不越过他的边界方面做得非常出色。但是，不能用从上到下的办法解决民主制度和自由秩序的问题。今天，跨越从左到右政治派别的几百万美国人，把美国在海外的努力视为类似帝国主义、“无休止的战争”和主宰世界的事情。他们不相信战后计划，拒绝为这种计划提供选民支持。 The real problem is in the seedbeds of democracy, the institutions that are supposed to mold a citizenry and make us qualified to practice democracy. To restore those seedbeds, we first have to relearn the wisdom of the founders: We are not as virtuous as we think we are. Americans are no better than anyone else. Democracy is not natural; it is an artificial accomplishment that takes enormous work. 真正的问题在于民主制度的苗床，在于那些本该塑造公民、让我们成为合格民主实践者的制度。要让这些苗床恢复健康，我们首先要重新学习建国元勋们的智慧：我们不像我们自己认为的那样有道德。美国人并不好于任何人。民主制度不是天生的；民主制度是需要付出巨大努力的人工构建。 Then we need to fortify the institutions that are supposed to teach the democratic skills: how to weigh evidence and commit to truth; how to correct for your own partisan blinders and learn to doubt your own opinions; how to respect people you disagree with; how to avoid catastrophism, conspiracy and apocalyptic thinking; how to avoid supporting demagogues; how to craft complex compromises. 再有，我们需要加强本应传授民主技能的机构：如何慎重考虑证据，坚持事实；如何纠正自己的党派偏见，学会怀疑自己的观点；如何尊重与你意见相左的人；如何避免祸患论、阴谋论和末日论思维；如何避免支持蛊惑民心的政客；如何达成复杂的妥协方案。 Democrats are not born; they are made. If the 21st century is to get brighter as it goes along, we have to get a lot better at making them. We don’t only have to worry about the people tearing down democracy. We have to worry about who is building it up. 民主实践者不是天生的，而是培养出来的。如果要让21世纪的未来变得越来越光明的话，我们必须在这方面做更多的努力。我们不仅要担心那些要摧毁民主制度的人。我们也必须关心那些将把这个制度变得更强的人。 David Brooks has been a columnist with The Times since 2003.

The promise of punishing sanctions in return by President Biden and the potential for Russian retaliation had already pushed down stock returns and driven up gas prices. 早在克里姆林宫周一下令俄罗斯军队进入寻求分裂的乌克兰地区之前，紧张局势就已经造成了损失。拜登总统以严厉制裁作为回应的承诺以及俄罗斯进行报复的可能性已经压低了股票回报并推高了汽油价格。 An outright attack by Russian troops could cause dizzying spikes in energy and food prices, fuel inflation fears and spook investors, a combination that threatens investment and growth in economies around the world. 俄罗斯军队的直接攻击可能会导致能源和食品价格飙升，加剧通胀担忧并吓跑投资者，这些因素会威胁到全球经济体的投资和增长。 However harsh the effects, the immediate impact will be nowhere near as devastating as the sudden economic shutdowns first caused by the coronavirus in 2020. Russia is a transcontinental behemoth with 146 million people and a huge nuclear arsenal, as well as a key supplier of the oil, gas and raw materials that keep the world’s factories running. But unlike China, which is a manufacturing powerhouse and intimately woven into intricate supply chains, Russia is a minor player in the global economy. 无论影响多么严重，其直接影响远不及2020年由新冠病毒首次造成的经济骤然停摆那样具有破坏性。俄罗斯是一个横贯大陆的巨型国家，拥有1.46亿人口和庞大的核武库，也是维持世界工厂运转的石油、天然气和原材料的供应国。但与中国不同，中国是紧密融入错综复杂供应链的制造业强国，而俄罗斯在全球经济中只是一个小角色。 Italy, with half the people and fewer natural resources, has an economy that is twice the size. Poland exports more goods to the European Union than Russia. 意大利的人口约为俄罗斯的一半，自然资源相对较少，但其经济规模是俄罗斯的两倍。波兰向欧盟出口的商品比俄罗斯多。 “Russia is incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was an adviser to President Barack Obama. “It’s basically a big gas station.” “除了石油和天然气，俄罗斯在全球经济中毫不重要，这令人难以置信，”哈佛大学经济学家、贝拉克·奥巴马总统顾问杰森·弗曼说。“它基本上是一个大加油站。” Of course, a closed gas station can be crippling for those who depend on it. The result is that any economic damage will be unevenly spread, intense in some countries and industries and unnoticed in others. 当然，一个关闭的加油站对于那些依赖它的人来说可能导致严重损失。其结果是经济损失分布不均匀，一些国家和行业受损严重，而在另一些国家和行业中则不会引起注意。 Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia, and is likely to be walloped with spikes in heating and gas bills, which are already soaring. Natural gas reserves are at less than a third of capacity, with weeks of cold weather ahead, and European leaders have already accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge. 欧洲近40%的天然气和25%的石油来自俄罗斯，并且很可能会受到已经飙升的供暖和天然气费用的冲击。由于未来数周的寒冷天气，天然气储量不到总容量的三分之一，欧洲领导人已经指责俄罗斯总统普京为了获取政治优势而减少供应。 And then there are food prices, which have climbed to their highest level in more than a decade largely because of the pandemic’s supply chain mess, according to a recent United Nations report. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat, and together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. For some countries, the dependence is much greater. That flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of Egypt and Turkey’s total wheat imports. 此外，根据联合国最近的一份报告，食品价格已攀升至十多年来的最高水平，大流行导致的供应链混乱是主要原因。俄罗斯是世界上最大的小麦供应国，与乌克兰一起占全球出口总量的近四分之一。一些国家对小麦的依赖性更高。来自那里的小麦占埃及和土耳其小麦进口总量的70%以上。 This will put further strain on Turkey, which is already in the middle of an economic crisis and struggling with inflation that is running close to 50 percent, with skyrocketing food, fuel and electricity prices. 这将给土耳其带来进一步的压力，该国已经处于经济危机之中，并且正在努力应对接近50%的通货膨胀，食品、燃料和用电价格飞涨。 And as usual, the burden falls heaviest on the most vulnerable. “Poorer people spend a higher share of incomes on food and heating,” said Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at Oxford University. 和往常一样，最脆弱的群体承受着最重的负担。牛津大学全球化与发展学教授伊恩·戈尔丁说：“穷人在食物和取暖方面花费占收入比例更高。” Ukraine, long known as the “breadbasket of Europe,” actually sends more than 40 percent of its wheat and corn exports to the Middle East or Africa, where there are worries that further food shortages and price increases could stoke social unrest. 长期以来被称为“欧洲粮仓”的乌克兰实际上将40%以上的小麦和玉米出口运送到中东或非洲，人们担心进一步的粮食短缺和价格上涨可能引发社会动荡。 Lebanon, for example, which is experiencing one of the most devastating economic crises in more than a century, gets more than half of its wheat from Ukraine, which is also the world’s largest exporter of seed oils like sunflower and rapeseed. 例如，黎巴嫩正经历一个多世纪以来最具破坏性的经济危机之一，其一半以上的小麦来自乌克兰，乌克兰也是世界上最大的葵花籽油和菜籽油等种子油的出口国。 On Monday, the White House responded to Mr. Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of two Russian-backed territories in the country’s east by saying it would begin imposing limited sanctions on the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Biden would soon issue an executive order prohibiting investment, trade and financing with people in those regions. 对于普京承认乌克兰东部两个俄罗斯支持的区域独立的决定，白宫于周一作出回应，称将开始对所谓的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克人民共和国实施有限制裁。白宫新闻秘书珍·萨基表示，拜登将很快发布一项行政命令，禁止与这些地区的人进行投资、贸易和融资交易。 Analysts watching the unfolding conflict have mapped out a range of scenarios from mild to severe. The fallout on working-class families and Wall Street traders depends on how an invasion plays out: whether Russian troops stay near the border or attack the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv; whether the fighting lasts for days or months; what kind of Western sanctions are imposed; and whether Mr. Putin responds by withholding critical gas supplies from Europe or launching insidious cyberattacks. 正在关注事态的分析人士已经列举了程度不一的一系列可能情况。冲突对工人阶级家庭和华尔街交易员各有什么样的影响，取决于入侵的结果：俄罗斯军队是留在边境附近还是袭击乌克兰首都基辅；战斗是持续几天还是几个月；西方实施了什么样的制裁；以及普京是否会通过暂停欧洲至关重要的天然气供应或发动阴险的网络攻击来做出回应。 “Think about it rolling out in stages,” said Julia Friedlander, director of the economic statecraft initiative at the Atlantic Council. “This is likely to play out as a slow motion drama.” “估计会是分阶段展开的，”大西洋理事会经济治国计划主任朱莉娅·弗里德兰德说。“这很可能会以一种慢动作戏剧的形式上演。” As became clear from the pandemic, minor interruptions in one region can generate major disruptions far away. Isolated shortages and price surges— whether of gas, wheat, aluminum or nickel — can snowball in a world still struggling to recover from the pandemic. 从大流行中可以清楚地看出，一个地区的轻微扰动可能会在遥远的地方产生重大破坏。世界仍在努力从大流行中恢复过来，孤立的短缺和价格飙升——无论是天然气、小麦、铝还是镍——都可能像滚雪球一样越来越严重。 “You have to look at the backdrop against which this is coming,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY-Parthenon. “There is high inflation, strained supply chains and uncertainty about what central banks are going to do and how insistent price rises are.” “对于这种即将到来的情况，你必须考虑它所处的背景，”安永-帕特农首席经济学家格雷戈里·达科表示。“存在高通胀、供应链紧张，而且不确定央行会怎么做，也不确定物价上涨会持续多久。” The additional stresses may be relatively small in isolation, but they are piling on economies that are still recovering from the economic body blows inflicted by the pandemic. 额外的压力单独来看可能相对不大，但它们堆积在仍在从大流行造成的打击中复苏的经济体上。 What’s also clear, Mr. Daco added, is that “political uncertainty and volatility weigh on economic activity.” 达科还说，还可以明确的是，“政治不确定性和波动性会影响经济活动。” That means an invasion could have a dual effect — slowing economic activity and raising prices. 这意味着入侵可能会产生双重影响——经济活动放缓和价格上涨。 In the United States, the Federal Reserve is already confronting the highest inflation in 40 years, at 7.5 percent in January, and is expected to start raising interest rates next month. Higher energy prices set off by a conflict in Europe may be transitory but they could feed worries about a wage-price spiral. 在美国，美联储已经面临40年来的最高通胀，1月份为7.5%，预计下个月将开始加息。欧洲冲突引发的能源价格上涨可能是暂时的，但它们可能会引发对工资价格螺旋上升的担忧。 “We could see a new burst of inflation,” said Christopher Miller, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and an assistant professor at Tufts University. 美国企业研究所客座研究员、塔夫茨大学助理教授克里斯托弗·米勒说：“我们可能会看到新一轮的通胀爆发。” Also fueling inflation fears are possible shortages of essential metals like palladium, aluminum and nickel, creating another disruption to global supply chains already suffering from the pandemic, trucker blockades in Canada and shortages of semiconductors. 钯、铝和镍等基本金属可能会短缺，这也加剧了对通胀的担忧，这对已经遭受大流行、加拿大卡车司机罢工和半导体短缺影响的全球供应链造成了又一次破坏。 The price of palladium, for example, used in automotive exhaust systems, mobile phones and even dental fillings, has soared in recent weeks because of fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, used to make steel and electric car batteries, has also been jumping. 例如，用于汽车排气系统、手机甚至齿科填充物的钯金属的价格在最近几周飙升，原因是担心这种金属的全球最大出口国俄罗斯可能会被全球市场拒之门外。用于制造钢铁和电动汽车电池的镍的价格也一直在上涨。 It’s too early to gauge the precise impact of an armed conflict, said Lars Stenqvist, the chief technology officer of Volvo, the Swedish truck maker. But he added, “It is a very, very serious thing.” 瑞典卡车制造商沃尔沃的首席技术官拉尔斯·斯滕奎斯特表示，现在评估武装冲突的确切影响还为时过早。但他还说，“这是一件非常非常严重的事情。” “We have a number of scenarios on the table and we are following the developments of the situation day by day,” Mr. Stenqvist said Monday. 斯滕奎斯特周一表示：“我们需要考虑的情况有很多，我们每天都在关注事态的发展。” The West has taken steps to blunt the impact on Europe if Mr. Putin decides to retaliate. The United States has ramped up delivery of liquefied natural gas and asked other suppliers like Qatar to do the same. 普京若要决定进行报复，西方已采取措施缓和对欧洲的影响。美国增加了液化天然气的供应，并要求卡塔尔等其他供应国也这样做。 The demand for oil might add momentum to negotiations to revive a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, which is estimated to have as many as 80 million barrels of oil in storage, has been locked out of much of the world’s markets since 2018, when President Donald J. Trump withdrew from the nuclear accord and reimposed sanctions. 对石油的需求可能会为恢复遏制伊朗核计划的协议增加谈判的动力。据估计，伊朗拥有多达8000万桶石油储备，自2018年特朗普总统退出核协议并重新实施制裁以来，它一直被排除在世界大部分市场之外。 Some of the sanctions against Russia that the Biden administration is considering, such as cutting off access to the system of international payments known as SWIFT or blocking companies from selling anything to Russia that contains American-made components, would hurt anyone who does business with Russia. But across the board, the United States is much less vulnerable than the European Union, which is Russia’s largest trading partner. 拜登政府正在考虑对俄罗斯实施的一些制裁措施——例如切断俄罗斯对被称为SWIFT的国际支付系统的访问权限，或阻止公司向俄罗斯出售任何含有美国制造组件的产品——将损害所有与俄罗斯有业务往来的人。但总体而言，美国的受损程度远不及俄罗斯最大的贸易伙伴欧盟。 Americans, as Mr. Biden has already warned, are likely to see higher gasoline prices. But because the United States is itself a large producer of natural gas, those price increases are not nearly as steep and as broad as elsewhere. And Europe has many more links to Russia and engages in more financial transactions — including paying for the Russian gas. 正如拜登已经警告的那样，美国人可能会面临更高的汽油价格。但由于美国本身就是一个天然气生产大国，因此这些价格上涨幅度并不像其他地方那么剧烈和广泛。而欧洲与俄罗斯的联系更多，参与的金融交易也更多——包括购买俄罗斯天然气的交易。 Oil companies like Shell and Total have joint ventures in Russia, while BP boasts that it “is one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia,” with ties to the Russian oil company Rosneft. Airbus, the European aviation giant, gets titanium from Russia. And European banks, particularly those in Germany, France and Italy, have lent billions of dollars to Russian borrowers. 壳牌和道达尔等石油公司在俄罗斯有合资企业，而英国石油则夸耀自己是“俄罗斯最大的外国投资者之一”，与俄罗斯石油公司有联系。欧洲航空巨头空中客车公司从俄罗斯进口钛。欧洲的银行，尤其是德国、法国和意大利的银行，已经向俄罗斯债务方提供了数十亿美元的贷款。 “Severe sanctions that hurt Russia painfully and comprehensively have potential to do huge damage to European customers,” said Adam Tooze, director of the European Institute at Columbia University. 哥伦比亚大学欧洲研究所所长亚当·图兹表示：“对俄罗斯造成痛苦和全面伤害的严厉制裁有可能对欧洲客户造成巨大损害。” Depending on what happens, the most significant effects on the global economy may manifest themselves only over the long run. 根据所发生的情况，对全球经济最重要的影响可能只有在长期内才会显现出来。 One result would be to push Russia to have closer economic ties to China. The two nations recently negotiated a 30-year contract for Russia to supply gas to China through a new pipeline. 其中一个结果将是推动俄罗斯与中国建立更紧密的经济联系。两国最近就俄罗斯通过一条新管道向中国供应天然气的30年合同进行了谈判。 “Russia is likely to pivot all energy and commodity exports to China,” said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. 高频经济首席经济学家卡尔·温伯格表示：“俄罗斯可能会将所有能源和大宗商品出口转向中国。” The crisis is also contributing to a reassessment of the global economy’s structure and concerns about self-sufficiency. The pandemic has already highlighted the downsides of far-flung supply chains that rely on lean production. 这场危机也促成了对全球经济结构的重新评估和对自给自足的担忧。疫情已经凸显了依赖精益生产的远距离供应链的弊端。 Now Europe’s dependence on Russian gas is spurring discussions about expanding energy sources, which could further sideline Russia’s presence in the global economy. 如今，欧洲对俄罗斯天然气的依赖引发了有关扩大能源来源的讨论，这可能会进一步削弱俄罗斯在全球经济中的地位。 “In the longer term, it’s going to push Europe to diversify,” said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow working on international trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. As for Russia, the real cost “would be corrosive over time and really making it much more difficult to do business with Russian entities and deterring investment.” 彼得森国际经济研究所国际贸易政策高级研究员杰弗里·肖特说：“长期来看，这将推动欧洲走向多元化。”至于俄罗斯，真正的成本“将随着时间的推移而恶化，真的会大大增加与俄罗斯实体做生意的难度，并阻碍投资。” Jack Ewing自纽约撰写关于商业方面的新闻，主要关注汽车行业及向电动汽车转型方面的新闻。他职业生涯的大部分时间都在欧洲度过，著有《更快，更高，更远》一书，该书讲述了关于大众排放量丑闻的故事。 Patricia Cohen报道国家经济新闻。自1997年加入时报以来，她还写过关于戏剧、书籍和思想的文章。她是《在我们的黄金时代：中年的迷人历史和充满希望的未来》的作者。 翻译：晋其角、明斋 ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/nyt2022022301/"},{"title":"【双语】The Limits of a Europe Whole and Free/欧洲还能保持\"完整而自由\"么？","content":" PARIS — For the prime minister of Lithuania — and Lithuania knows something of life in Moscow’s imperium — President Vladimir V. Putin’s rambling dismissal of Ukrainian statehood, used to justify sending Russian troops into the eastern part of that state, “put Kafka and Orwell to shame.” 巴黎——立陶宛了解莫斯科帝国的行为方式，用其总理的话来说，总统普京为证明向乌克兰东部派遣俄罗斯军队的正当性而否认乌克兰国家地位的长篇大论，“让卡夫卡和奥威尔都自惭形秽。” There were “no lows too low, no lies too blatant,” the prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, said of Mr. Putin’s menacing explanation on Monday of his decision to recognize two separatist regions of Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk. But if the speech revived the doublespeak of the Soviet Union, more than 30 years after its demise, did it also rekindle the Soviet threat and the Cold War that went with it? 周一，立陶宛总理英格丽达·西蒙尼特在谈到普京决定承认乌克兰的两个分离主义地区——顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克时的威胁性解释时说，“没有比这更无耻的行为，也没有比这更公然的谎言”。但是，在苏联解体30年后，如果这次讲话再次让人看到了苏联的欺人之谈，那么它是否也重新点燃了苏联的威胁和与之相伴的冷战？ On many levels, the challenge Mr. Putin’s revanchist Russia presents to the West is different. This Russia has no pretense of a global ideology. The Cold War depended on closed systems; computer technology put an end to that. No Soviet tanks are poised to roll across the Prussian plains and absorb all Europe in a totalitarian empire. Nuclear Armageddon is not on the table. 在许多层面上，普京的复仇主义俄罗斯向西方发起的挑战不同于苏联。这个俄罗斯没有假装某种全球意识形态。冷战依赖于封闭系统，而计算机技术结束了这一状态。不再有苏联坦克准备横穿普鲁士平原，将整个欧洲纳入一个极权帝国。核武器末日议题也可以先放到一边。 Yet, perhaps because of the way he prepared the ground for full-scale war, saying Russia has “every right to take retaliatory measures” against what he called a fictive nation led by usurpers who would be responsible for the bloodshed, Mr. Putin’s decision felt like a breaking point that went beyond his annexation of Crimea in 2014. It held up the specter of Europe’s darkest days. He laid down a marker, setting the outer limit of the Europe whole and free of 1989. 然而，也许是因为普京为全面战争铺平道路的方式，他说俄罗斯“完全有权采取报复措施”对付他所谓的虚假国家——这些由篡夺者领导的国家将对流血事件负责。普京的决定感觉就像一个突破点，超越了他在2014年对克里米亚的吞并。它让欧洲陷入对最黑暗的日子的恐惧。他放置了一个标记，设定了1989年那个完整而自由欧洲的外部边界。 The Russian president’s aggressive move was a slap in the face to President Emmanuel Macron of France, who has led efforts to engage with Russia, and it left, at least for now, the idea of some reconfigured European security architecture moribund. 俄罗斯总统咄咄逼人的举动是对法国总统马克龙的一记耳光，后者一直带头努力与俄罗斯接触，这导致——至少目前看来——一些重新配置欧洲安全架构的想法已经停滞不前。 In its place, division and confrontation loomed in a world marked by what Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called “President Putin’s flagrant disrespect for international law and norms.” The White House called Russia’s move “the beginning of an invasion.” 在这个国务卿安东尼·布林肯所说的“普京总统公然蔑视国际法和规范”为标志的世界，取而代之的是迫在眉睫的分裂和对抗。白宫称俄罗斯的举动是“入侵的开始”。 China, walking a fine line between its support for Mr. Putin and its support for the territorial integrity of sovereign nations, has declined to criticize Russia, while saying those norms must be upheld. Still, in a month when Russia and China cemented a friendship with “no limits,” Mr. Putin’s order to dispatch troops into Ukraine suggested how Russian military might and Chinese ideological and economic heft might form a potent anti-democratic front. 中国在对普京的支持和对主权国家领土完整的支持之间选择了一条微妙的界限，它拒绝批评俄罗斯，同时又表示这些规范必须得到维护。尽管如此，在俄罗斯和中国宣布“没有止境”地巩固友好关系一个月不到，普京下令向乌克兰派遣军队表明，俄罗斯的军事实力以及中国的意识形态和经济影响力将形成一个强有力的反民主阵线。 President Biden has often referred to an “inflection point” between liberal democracy and autocratic systems. For now, that point seems to lie in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of a country whose name means borderland. 拜登总统经常提到自由民主和专制制度之间的“拐点”。目前，这个拐点似乎就在一个国家的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克地区，而这个国家的名字意思是边界。 How far Mr. Putin is prepared to go remains unclear. A senior French official at the presidency, who insisted on anonymity in line with government practice, described the Russian leader’s speech as at once “rigid and, I would say, paranoid.” 普京准备走多远，目前还不清楚。法国总统府的一名高级官员形容俄罗斯领导人的讲话既“刻板，而且在我看来，又偏执”。根据政府惯例，此人坚持匿名。 This, he suggested, was in keeping with the man Mr. Macron found at the end of a 20-foot table in the Kremlin earlier this month, and later described to journalists on his plane as more stiff, isolated and ideologically unyielding than at their previous meeting in 2019. 他表示，这个描述与马克龙本月早些时候在克里姆林宫六米长桌尽头看到的那个人是一致的，后来马克龙在飞机上向记者描述，普京比他们在2019年的上次会面中看上去更加死板、孤立，并且在意识形态上决不妥协。 Still, as Polonius put it in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.” 尽管如此，正如莎士比亚的《哈姆雷特》中波洛尼厄斯所说，“这些虽然是疯话，却有深意在内。” Mr. Putin, for all his wild imaginings about Ukraine as the “forward springboard” for some American pre-emptive strike against Russia, has been relentlessly building his case against NATO expansion to Russia’s borders and against Western democracies since the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. The estimated 190,000 Russian and separatist troops on the Ukrainian border and in its breakaway regions are only the latest expression of this obsession. 普京一直妄想乌克兰是美国先发制人打击俄罗斯的“前进跳板”，自2008年俄罗斯入侵格鲁吉亚以来，他一直在坚持不懈地反对北约向俄罗斯边境扩张以及反对西方民主国家。在乌克兰边境及其分离地区估计有19万俄罗斯和分离主义军队就是这种执念的最新表现。 The open question is whether Mr. Putin has become weaker or stronger as a result of this drive. 这种推动力使普京变得更弱还是更强，目前尚不清楚 In some respects he has achieved the opposite of his intentions. American officials argue that he has galvanized and united a NATO alliance that was casting around for a raison d’être. He shifted Ukrainian public opinion decisively against Russia and toward an embrace of NATO and the West. He damaged an already vulnerable, undiversified economy, with Germany’s blocking on Tuesday of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline just the latest blow. 在某些方面，他取得了与他的意图相反的结果。美国官员表示，普京激发并团结了一个四处寻找存在价值的北约联盟。他使乌克兰的公众舆论果断地转向反对俄罗斯，拥护北约和西方。他破坏了一个本就脆弱、单一的经济体，德国在周二叫停了耗资110亿美元的“北溪2号”天然气管道，这只是最新的打击。 One poll this month in Ukraine by the Rating Group organization found support for NATO membership at a record high 62 percent, up from 55 percent in December. 本月，民意调查机构Rating Group在乌克兰进行的一项调查发现，支持乌克兰加入北约的人数从去年12月的55%上升到62%，达到历史最高水平。 “He has turned Ukraine against Russia,” said Jacques Rupnik, a French political scientist focused on central European countries. “That is quite an achievement.” “他让乌克兰与俄罗斯对立，”关注中欧国家的法国政治学家雅克·鲁普尼克说。“这是一个相当大的成就。” At the same time, however, Mr. Putin has proved effective on several fronts. The humiliated Russia of the immediate post-Cold-War years struts the global stage once more, winning the end game in Syria, working effectively through paramilitary surrogates in Africa, cementing a bond with China. 与此同时，普京已经在几个方面证实了自己的效率。冷战刚结束时曾遭到羞辱的俄罗斯再次登上全球舞台，它在叙利亚赢得了最终胜利，通过在非洲的准军事代理人有效开展工作，还巩固了与中国的关系。 The Russian president has suspended Georgia and Ukraine in strategic limbo through the frozen conflicts he has created there. NATO membership for Georgia is no longer talked about much. Ukraine’s membership seems infinitely distant, almost unimaginable, even to its closest Western allies. 俄罗斯总统通过他在格鲁吉亚和乌克兰制造的“冻结冲突”，将两国置于战略困境中。格鲁吉亚加入北约的问题已不再被广泛讨论。乌克兰的成员国身份似乎遥不可及，甚至对其最亲密的西方盟友来说，也是几乎无法想象的。 In 2013, President Barack Obama decided not to bomb Syria after Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, had crossed an American “red line” against using chemical weapons. Since then, Russia has moved aggressively in the apparent conviction that no provocation outside NATO countries will bring armed American reprisal. 2013年，在叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德越过美国禁止使用化学武器的“红线”后，奥巴马总统决定不轰炸叙利亚。自那以后，俄罗斯采取了积极行动，显然因为该国确信，针对北约以外国家的任何挑衅都不会招致美国的武装报复。 Mr. Putin’s decision on Monday to recognize the two breakaway regions was the latest example of this probing. Mr. Biden has made clear that no American troops will be sent to die for Ukraine. 普京周一承认这两个分离地区是最新的试探之举。拜登已经明确表示，不会派遣美国军队为乌克兰牺牲。 NATO expansion eastward after the fall of the Berlin Wall was designed to secure and safeguard the freedom of 100 million central Europeans who had escaped the Soviet imperium. It worked. One thing Mr. Putin has not done is threaten Poles or Romanians with renewed Russian subjugation. 柏林墙倒塌后，北约东扩的目的是保障和保护逃离苏联统治的一亿中欧人的自由。它发挥了作用。目前普京还没有威胁波兰人或罗马尼亚人，让他们重新接受俄罗斯的征服。 Its price, however, has been the festering alienation of Russia, which felt it had been betrayed by NATO at its border. This anger was redoubled in 2008 when NATO leaders issued a summit declaration in Bucharest saying that Ukraine and Georgia, once part of the Soviet Union, “will become members of NATO.” They did not say how or when because they did not know — leaving the commitment floating in a sea of treacherous vagueness. 然而，北约所付出的代价是与俄罗斯日益疏远，因为后者认为北约在其边境地区背叛了自己。2008年，让俄罗斯更加愤怒的是，北约领导人在布加勒斯特发表了一份峰会宣言，称曾经属于苏联的乌克兰和格鲁吉亚“将成为北约成员”。北约没有说这将在何时实现，也没有说要怎么做，因为它自己也不知道——这一承诺就这样漂浮在一片模糊莫测的海洋中。 “It was an absolutely disastrous decision,” Mr. Rupnik said. “Either you say you will take Ukraine in by a certain date assuming certain conditions are met, or you say Ukraine’s place is not in NATO and we will devise an alternative strategic framework for the neighborhood between NATO and Russia. This was the worst of both worlds.” “这绝对是一个灾难性的决定，”鲁普尼克说。“要么你说，如果某些条件得到满足，你将在某个日期前接纳乌克兰，要么你说，乌克兰的位置不属于北约，我们将为北约和俄罗斯之间的邻国设计一个替代战略框架。现在是两个世界中最糟糕的情况。” Just how bad is now apparent. Russia’s demand that NATO commit to never admitting Ukraine has been met by the West’s insistence that NATO’s door will remain open, even if nobody is prepared to say how Ukraine would ever squeeze through that door. 情况有多坏现在已经很明显了。俄罗斯要求北约承诺永远不接纳乌克兰，但西方坚持北约的大门将保持敞开，即使没有人准备好说出乌克兰将如何挤进这扇门。 The West has complicated its position in other ways, too. As Marko Milanovic, a professor of international law at the University of Nottingham, pointed out in the European Journal of International Law Blog: “No matter how fantastical some Russian claims may be, the credibility of Western allies in responding to Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty remains deeply undermined, on the law and on the facts, by their own previous misadventures, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq.” 西方在其他方面也使得自己的立场复杂化。正如诺丁汉大学国际法教授马尔科·米拉诺维奇在《欧洲国际法期刊》博客上指出的那样：“不管俄罗斯的一些说法多么不切实际，西方盟友在回应俄罗斯侵犯乌克兰主权时的可信度，无论是从法律上还是从事实上，都被他们自己之前的错误行为深深损害，包括2003年对伊拉克的入侵。” In the end, Mr. Putin did what he did because he thinks he can get away with it in an unanchored world of growing Great Power rivalry, where American power is no longer determinant and the Russian-Chinese alignment is strong. But hubris is always a danger for a leader as isolated as Mr. Putin appears to be today. 归根结底，普京之所以这么做，是因为他认为，在一个大国竞争日益加剧、美国的力量不再是决定性因素、俄中结盟非常强大的世界里，他做任何事都可以不受惩罚。但是，对于一个像如今的普京这样看上去孤立的领导人来说，自负总是危险的。 The most difficult thing for a communist, it has been observed, is to predict the past. History must be molded to the imperatives of the present. That is what Mr. Putin, the former K.G.B. agent, has tried to do. The coming weeks will tell if Ukrainian anger, rediscovered NATO unity, and American determination can stop his attempt to reverse the consequences of Soviet unraveling. 据观察，对于一个共产主义者来说，最困难的事情是预测过去。历史必须按照当前的需要来塑造。这就是前克格勃特工普京试图做的事情。接下来的几周将会告诉我们，乌克兰的愤怒、北约重新到来的团结以及美国的决心，是否能够阻止他扭转苏联解体后果的企图。 Roger Cohen是《纽约时报》巴黎分社社长，自2009年至2020年期间担任专栏作者。他为《纽约时报》工作了30多年，曾任驻外记者和驻外编辑。他在南非和英国长大，后来入籍美国。 翻译：明斋、晋其角 ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/nyt2022022302/"},{"title":"【双语】Opinion | The Comedian-Turned-President Is Seriously in Over His Head/从喜剧演员到元首，乌克兰总统泽伦斯基的真面目","content":" KYIV, Ukraine — It’s not hard to guess what President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine must be craving right now: one normal day. 乌克兰基辅——乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽伦斯基现在渴望的东西不难猜到：正常的一天。 The comic-turned-president surely never imagined the job would be quite so intense. First, he got tangled up in the impeachment of Donald Trump. Then he had to deal with the Covid pandemic. And now he’s facing the prospect of a full-scale invasion by Russia. 这位由喜剧演员转行而来的总统肯定没有想到，这份工作竟会如此紧张。首先，他卷入了对唐纳德·特朗普的弹劾。然后，他不得不应对新冠疫情。现在，他又面临着俄罗斯的全面入侵。 Russia, of course, has been waging a war in eastern Ukraine since 2014. But now the threat is total: Up to 190,000 Russian troops have amassed near Ukraine’s borders and in separatist regions, and an invasion, bringing devastation and disaster, could come at any time. It’s a gravely serious situation. And Mr. Zelensky, a comedian for most of his life, is in over his head. 当然，俄罗斯自2014年以来一直在乌克兰东部发动战争。但现在的威胁是全面的：多达19万俄罗斯军队已经集结在乌克兰边境和分离主义地区附近，随时可能发生带来破坏和灾难的入侵。局面非常严重。一生中大部分时间都在做喜剧演员的泽伦斯基如今不知所措。 When Mr. Zelensky took power in Ukraine in 2019, converting his TV fame into a stellar political career, no one knew what to expect. His opponents said he was so inexperienced, he was bound to be a disaster. His supporters thought that he would break away from the old ways and end corruption. His harshest critics claimed that Mr. Zelensky, a Russian-speaking man born in eastern Ukraine, would all but sell the country off to Russia. Others said he was an oligarch puppet. 2019年上台时，他将在电视上赢来的名声转变为辉煌的政治生涯，没人知道会发生什么。他的对手说他太缺乏经验，注定是个灾难。他的支持者认为他会打破旧的方式，结束腐败。他最严厉的批评者称，出生在乌克兰东部、说俄语的泽伦斯基几乎肯定会把这个国家出卖给俄罗斯。还有人说他是寡头政治的傀儡。 Yet the truth is more prosaic. Mr. Zelensky, the showman and performer, has been unmasked by reality. And it has revealed him to be dispiritingly mediocre. 然而，事实却更加平淡无奇。泽伦斯基，这名演艺人士和表演者，已经被现实揭开了他的面具，暴露出他只是令人沮丧的平庸之辈。 After his nearly three years in office, it’s clear what the problem is: Mr. Zelensky’s tendency to treat everything like a show. Gestures, for him, are more important than consequences. Strategic objectives are sacrificed for short-term benefits. The words he uses don’t matter, as long as they are entertaining. And when the reviews are bad, he stops listening and surrounds himself with fans. 在他担任总统近三年之后，问题很明显了：泽伦斯基倾向于把一切都当作一场表演。对他来说，姿态比结果更重要。为了短期利益，战略目标被牺牲了。他使用什么词语并不重要，只要有趣就行。如果风评很差，他就会不再倾听，让自己置身粉丝的包围之中。 He started brightly. Early in his tenure, Mr. Zelensky commanded more power than any of his predecessors had. His fame and anti-establishment allure landed him with a parliamentary majority, a handpicked cabinet and a mandate for reform. 刚开始他的前景一片光明。在任职初期，泽伦斯基掌握的权力比任何一位前任都大。他的名声和反体制的魅力使他获得了议会多数席位、一个精心挑选的内阁和改革的授权。 At first, it seemed to be working. His government opened up the farmland market and expanded digital services across the country. He began an enormous road construction program, proclaiming that he wanted to be remembered as the president who finally built good roads in Ukraine. 一开始，这似乎是有效的。他的政府开放了农田市场，并在全国范围内扩大数字服务。他开始了一项庞大的道路建设计划，宣称他希望人们最终会因为他是在乌克兰修建了优良道路的总统而记住他。 But the successes largely stopped there. Mr. Zelensky’s other major project, a campaign he calls “deoligarchization” that’s aimed at capping the influence of the very wealthy, looks more like a P.R. move than serious policy. Despite his campaign promises, no progress has been made in fighting corruption. 但他的成功基本上止步于此。泽伦斯基的另一个重大项目是一项被他称为“去寡头化”的运动，旨在限制非常富有者的影响力，它看起来更像是一项公关举措，而不是严肃的政策。尽管他在竞选时做出了承诺，但在打击腐败方面却没有取得任何进展。 According to Transparency International, Ukraine remains the third-most-corrupt country in Europe, after Russia and Azerbaijan. Anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies are either stalling or run by loyalists appointed by the president. 根据透明国际的数据，乌克兰仍然是欧洲第三腐败的国家，仅次于俄罗斯和阿塞拜疆。反腐败和执法机构要么停滞不前，要么由总统任命的亲信管理。 Corruption just doesn’t seem to worry Mr. Zelensky much — at least when those implicated are close to him. In March 2020, when his chief of staff’s brother was caught offering government posts for money, Mr. Zelensky did nothing. 泽伦斯基似乎并不太担心腐败问题——至少当那些牵涉其中的人与他关系密切时是这样。2020年3月，当泽伦斯基幕僚长的兄弟被发现提供政府职位以换取金钱时，泽伦斯基什么也没做。 More recently, a top lawmaker was caught on camera drunkenly offering a bribe to a police officer at the site of a car crash he might have caused. The public was outraged, but Mr. Zelensky mumbled a disapproving comment and moved on. Even the president’s beautiful newly built roads are mired in controversy. The procurement process is thought to be rigged and the prices too high. 最近，一名醉酒的高级议员在一场可能是由他造成的车祸现场向警察行贿，被摄像头拍了下来。公众被激怒了，但泽伦斯基只是含含糊糊地说了一句表示不赞成的话，然后就当没事了。就连总统新建的漂亮道路也陷入了争议。人们认为，采购过程存在暗箱操作，价格过高。 Scandals and tolerance for corruption have chipped away at Mr. Zelensky’s popularity. Sixty-two percent of Ukrainians don’t want him to run for re-election, and if an election were held today, he’d garner about 25 percent of the vote — down from the 30 percent he easily won in the first round of the 2019 election. He’d still be likely to win, but the historic 73 percent he scored in the second round feels like a distant memory. 丑闻和对腐败的容忍削弱了泽伦斯基的支持率。62%的乌克兰人不希望他竞选连任，如果今天举行选举，他将获得大约25%的选票，低于他在2019年第一轮选举中轻松赢得的30%。他仍然有可能获胜，但他在第二轮选举中历史性的73%的得票已经成为遥远的记忆。 The president's tense relationship with the press doesn't help, either. A former actor used to the sound of applause, Mr. Zelensky is notoriously thin-skinned when it comes to criticism and challenging questions. He is visibly irritated by traditional journalists: In November, this fractious approach led to unseemly confrontations at a news conference. 总统与媒体的紧张关系对事态也没有帮助。泽伦斯基曾经是演员，习惯听到掌声，在受到批评和质疑时，他是出了名的脸皮薄。他对传统记者明显感到恼火：去年11月，这种难以控制的做法导致了一场新闻发布会上发生不体面的对峙。 It’s not just the media Mr. Zelensky struggles to work with. His first year in charge was chaotic. His hastily assembled team quickly fell apart, and yesterday’s allies turned into some of his harshest critics. There were constant reshuffles. New ministers were given very little time to prove themselves and were kicked out if they didn't. 泽伦斯基不只跟媒体相处不好。他执政的第一年很混乱。他匆忙组建的团队很快分崩离析，昨天的盟友变成了他最严厉的批评者。经常有人事变动。新部长们没有多少时间来证明自己，如果他们做不到就会被踢出局。 The churn eventually stopped, but at a cost. Mr. Zelensky, stung by the fallout, came to largely rely on the loyal rather than the qualified. 混乱最终停止了，但付出了代价。泽伦斯基被这些反目的后果刺痛，之后他在很大程度上依赖于忠诚的人，而不是合格的人。 A former movie producer and longtime friend was made chief of staff, joining other friends and confidants of Mr. Zelensky in wielding outsize power. The security service is overseen by a childhood friend, a former corporate lawyer, and the president’s party in Parliament is run by a loyal former I.T. businessman. The circle around the president has become an echo chamber. 泽伦斯基的一位曾是电影制片人的老朋友被任命为幕僚长，与他的其他朋友和知己们一起行使着巨大的权力。安全部门由他的一位曾是企业律师的发小监管，而总统在议会中的政党则由一位忠诚的前信息技术商人掌管。总统周围的圈子变成了回音室。 In the process, Mr. Zelensky has turned into a version of the politician he campaigned against: insular, closed off, surrounded by yes men. In normal circumstances, that would be bad enough. But now, when Ukraine is menaced by Russia, it may be affecting Mr. Zelensky's judgment. 在这个过程中，泽伦斯基变成了他竞选时反对的那种政界人士：孤僻、封闭，周围都是唯唯诺诺的人。在正常情况下，这已经够糟糕的了。但现在，当乌克兰受到俄罗斯的威胁时，这可能会影响泽伦斯基的判断。 That's become ever clearer in recent weeks. As the West pursued megaphone diplomacy to discourage an invasion, Mr. Zelensky tried to downplay the threat. But this understandable effort to project calm and steady skittish markets was undermined by his showy style. 这在最近几周变得越来越清晰。在西方寻求传声筒外交以阻止入侵之际，泽伦斯基试图淡化威胁。这种为安抚动荡的市场而做出的努力是可以理解的，但却被他爱炫耀的风格所破坏。 In a tone-deaf address in January, for example, a patronizing Mr. Zelensky effectively mocked Ukrainians for their proneness to panic and laughed off a possible invasion. The very next day, he claimed Russia might invade Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Instead of being comforted, the country was confused. No wonder 53 percent of Ukrainians think Mr. Zelensky won’t be able to defend the country if there is an invasion. 例如，在今年1月一次不合时宜的演讲中，傲慢的泽伦斯基实际上是在嘲笑乌克兰人容易恐慌，并对可能的入侵一笑置之。就在第二天，他声称俄罗斯可能会入侵乌克兰第二大城市哈尔科夫。这个国家不但没有得到安慰，反而感到困惑。难怪53%的乌克兰人认为，如果发生入侵，泽伦斯基将无法保卫国家。 Yet Mr. Zelensky’s behavior, odd to the point of erratic, obscures a truth: He has no good options. 然而，泽伦斯基古怪到诡异程度的行为掩盖了这样一个事实：他没有什么好的选择。 On the one hand, any concession to Russia, particularly over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, would likely bring hundreds of thousands of people to the streets — threatening him with the fate of Viktor Yanukovych, the president overthrown by a revolution in 2014. 一方面，对俄罗斯的任何让步，尤其是在乌克兰东部的冲突问题上，都可能会导致数十万人上街游行——这将令他面临2014年被革命推翻的总统维克多·亚努科维奇的命运。 Any decisive move against Russia, on the other hand, risks giving the Kremlin a pretext for a deadly invasion. 另一方面，针对俄罗斯的任何明确行动都可能给克里姆林宫提供发动致命入侵的借口。 The show must go on, of course. The crisis continues. But the president’s performance — strained, awkward, often inappropriate — is hardly helping. 当然，演出必须继续下去。危机仍在延续。但总统的表现——紧张、尴尬、经常不得体——对事态几乎没有帮助。 Olga Rudenkois the chief editor of The Kyiv Independent, a Ukrainian news site.

In Beijing, it has been a whole other story. 即便在最好的条件下，在为这项运动而建的体育馆中，任务也是艰巨的。而在北京，情况则是难上加难。 The world’s experts on creating ice worthy of Olympic-class curling were handed a challenge more daunting than anything they had faced: Turn an Olympic-size swimming pool in the National Aquatics Center into lanes of ice ready for the world’s best curlers. 全世界制造奥运级冰壶比赛所需冰块的专家们面临着一个前所未有的挑战：将国家游泳中心里的奥运级泳池变成冰道，为全世界最出色冰壶运动员的竞逐做好准备。 “It’s never really been done before,” said Hans R. Wuthrich, the chief ice technician for curling at the Beijing Games, his fourth Olympics and just one of many elite competitions in his decades-long career. “这是以前从未有过的，”北京冬奥会首席冰类技术员汉斯·R·伍思里希表示，这是他的第四届冬奥会，他在数十年职业生涯中参与过众多顶级赛事。 2008年夏季奥运会使用过的泳池被改造为四个冰壶泳池 Chinese officials have boasted about Beijing’s status as the only city that has hosted both the Summer and Winter Games — a feat achieved, in part, by recycling venues built for the 2008 Olympics. 对于北京成为唯一一座同时举办过夏季和冬季奥运会的城市，中国官员自豪不已。北京实现这一成就的部分原因就在于对2008年奥运会场馆的重新利用。 Curling events are in the natatorium with the honeycomb exterior, which was known in 2008 as the Water Cube and where Michael Phelps won eight gold medals for the United States. For the Winter Games, it has been rechristened as the Ice Cube. But getting it ready was hardly as simple as changing its name. 冰壶赛事被放在这座外观如蜂巢的游泳馆进行，2008年，这里被称为“水立方”，迈克尔·菲尔普斯曾在此为美国赢得八枚金牌。该场馆因冬奥会被改名为“冰立方”。但为比赛做好准备，可不像改名那样简单。 A first challenge was to construct the infrastructure to hold up the ice. The pool was filled with a metal scaffolding system topped by a layer of concrete. 首当其冲的难题就是建造支撑冰层的基础设施。泳池里搭满了钢架结构，顶部铺有一层混凝土。 Then came making the ice — and an early obstacle: The Cube’s tap water had a reading of 375 parts per million of total dissolved solids, like salts, minerals and ions. That amount is acceptable for drinking water, but freeze it, and it’s still not good enough to curl on. The impurities affect the ability to make the sheets as flat as they can be. 然后就是制冰，这也是早期遇到的一个障碍：水立方的自来水中总溶解固体（比如盐、矿物质和离子）的含量为百万分之375。这种含量作为饮用水没问题，但若是冰冻凝固，仍不能满足冰壶比赛的要求。这些杂质会影响冰层的平展能力。 The team used filtration systems to clear the water. But by the time they were done, it was too pure for human consumption. 设计团队使用了过滤系统来净水。但当过滤完成，水质又过纯，不再适合人类饮用。 “If you actually drank it,” Mark Callan, the deputy ice technician for the curling events, said, “it would burn your insides.” “如果你真的喝了，”冰壶项目的副冰类技术员马克·卡兰表示，“内脏都会被烧伤。” Outside, water freezes from the top down, creating a surface that is wildly inconsistent. Inside, “you’ve got to go very slowly,” Callan said, “and allow it to freeze the water from the bottom up.” 在户外，水是自上而下结冰，形成极不稳定的表面。但在室内，“你得慢慢来，”卡兰说，“让水从底部向上结冰。” Once the upper layers freeze, white paint, logos and other markings are added. In all, the ice is 10 centimeters thick, or nearly four inches. 一旦上层结冰，就可以添加白色油漆、标志和其他标记。冰层总厚度达到10厘米。 The next hurdle was the air. The building was too dry — “which is a bit ironic,” Callan said, “being we’re in a swimming pool.” 接下来的障碍就是空气。卡兰说，场馆太过干燥，“这有点讽刺，毕竟我们是在一个游泳池里。” The team installed a system of humidifiers releasing a constant mist around the periphery of the ice. That still wasn’t enough. Wuthrich took pride in the solution: filling a smaller pool not far from the ice with hot water. “Everyone thinks we are absolutely crazy,” he said in a post on Twitter, along with a photograph showing it off. 设计团队安装了一个加湿系统，在冰面外围不断释放水雾。但这依然不够。对于最终的解决方案——在离冰面不远的一处小水池里储满热水——伍思里希对此相当得意。“所有人都认为我们肯定是疯了，”他在一篇推文中写到，并附上了展示水池的照片。 Even after the ice is frozen to their specifications, the technicians continue fussing over details, monitoring the ice and the atmosphere around it at a granular level: too warm, too cold, too much moisture, too little moisture, not enough texture for the stone to glide. Any deviation can have an outsize impact on the competition. 即便在冻结的冰已经符合规格后，技术员们也还要为细节操心，对冰面及其周围空气的检测无比细致：太热、太冷、水分太多、水分太少、冰面纹理不足以让冰壶滑行。任何偏差都可能对比赛造成巨大影响。 “We work within a thousandth of an inch of accuracy,” Wuthrich said after his team finished the ice for a round of women’s matches. “我们工作的精度堪称细至毫厘，”伍思里在他的团队为女子项目的一轮赛事完成冰面布置后说道。 The precision of the work contradicts a notion that as far as Olympic sports go, curling is easy. The sport is widely accessible, and in amateur clubs, participants go for a beer and a good time. 这项工作对精度的要求，与人们对奥运赛事的一种观念相矛盾，即冰壶是很轻松的运动。它随处可见，在业余俱乐部里，参赛者往往喝一喝啤酒然后玩一局。 But at the Olympic level, it is driven by athleticism and strategy, and the ability to read and know the ice is a key to winning. As much as the brooms and the stones, it is about the ice. 但在奥运赛场上，冰壶考验的是运动能力和策略，解读比赛和熟悉冰面是获胜的关键。冰的作用，就和冰刷、冰壶一样重要。 “It’s a game of skill, not a game of chance,” Callan said. “So if you can’t provide consistent conditions, then you start to negate the skill level, and it becomes more of a game of chance — and it’s our job to make sure that’s not the case.” “这是比拼技巧的游戏，而不是看运气，”卡兰说。“因此，如果不能提供稳定条件，那就会抵消技巧的作用，比赛就更像在碰运气——而我们的工作就是确保这种情况不能发生。” 用检测冰面的程序来提升国家游泳中心的适度 Wuthrich and Callan — along with a third ice technician, Shawn Olesen — were drawn to this niche career by a passion for curling. They have day jobs. Wuthrich, who lives in Manitoba, owns a landscaping company and nursery; Callan, who lives in Glasgow, Scotland, is the director of sales for the company that makes the stones used in elite curling events by mining granite from an island off Scotland. 伍思里希、卡兰以及另一位冰类技术员肖恩·奥尔森之所以选择这份事业，都是出于对冰壶的热爱。他们都有其他正职工作。伍思里希住在曼尼托巴省，拥有一家园林公司和苗圃；卡兰住在苏格兰格拉斯哥，在一家冰壶制造企业做销售总监，公司从苏格兰一座小岛上开采花岗岩，生产用于顶级冰壶赛事的冰壶。 As much as they find the work satisfying, they also acknowledge the pressure that comes with it. 尽管这份工作给了他们极大满足感，但他们也承认，随之而来的压力是很大的。 “It’s the pinnacle of everything, and as an ice maker, it’s the same thing,” Wuthrich said of the Olympics. “You’ve got to be on your toes all the time. If any little thing happens, you have to fix it. You have to make it the best possible because people tried for 20 years to get to this event.” “这是所有赛事的巅峰，对于制冰商来说也一样，”伍思里希这样评价奥运会。“你必须时刻保持警惕。若是出了什么小问题，都必须解决。你必须尽可能做到最好，因为那些人为了参与这项赛事付出了20年的努力。” One night, before the day’s last round of games, the three technicians — along with a crew of nearly two dozen Chinese volunteers, most of them college students — went through their ice preparation routine. 一天晚上，在当日最后一轮比赛开始前，这三位技术员——还有二十来名中国志愿者，其中大多数是学生——进行了冰上准备工作。 The crew used an ice scraper to even out the lanes. Callan wore a backpack with a canister of water and a sprayer that looked like a shower head. Strutting backward on the lanes, he sprayed droplets of water to create the texture that allows the stones to move across the flat surface and spin. 他们用刮冰器来平整赛道。卡伦的背包里装有一罐水和一个看起来像花洒的喷雾器。他在赛道上迈着大步倒着走，边走边喷水，制造出纹理，让冰壶能在冰面上移动和旋转。 冰壶移动器带动一排冰壶划过冰面，模拟比赛过程，对冰面做磨合处理 Then they took out a contraption called a rock mover, which allowed them to rake a line of curling stones across the ice to simulate play. They want the ice to be broken in for the players. 然后，他们拿出了一个叫做冰壶移动器的装置，在冰面上排出一行冰壶模拟比赛。他们要通过使用新冰面给运动员做好准备。 In a final step, Callan went out with a single stone and tested it. Under the terms of their contract, they have to provide ice on which a stone can travel the length of the sheet in roughly 25 seconds, with four to five feet of curl. They aim to keep the surface temperature of the ice at roughly 23 degrees Fahrenheit. 最后一步，卡兰拿出一只冰壶进行测试。根据合同条款，他们制造的冰面必须让冰壶能在24或25秒内移动1.2米至1.5米的距离。他们要把冰面温度控制在零下五度左右。 The days are long and getting longer. They arrived in Beijing a month ago, and there have been over a dozen days of competition, with as many as three rounds of games per day. On the job, Wuthrich walks about 10 kilometers a day; because he does the texture pebbling, Callan gets in 12 kilometers. 工作很繁重，并且越来越繁重。他们一个月前抵达北京，自那以后已经进行了十多天的比赛，单日赛事最多达到三轮。工作时，伍思里希每天要步行10公里；卡兰因为还得做冰面纹理，单日步行距离可达12公里。 They start each morning at 6. Lately, problems have kept creeping up, meaning they are often working until 1 a.m. 他们每天早上6点就要开始工作。最近问题不断出现，意味着他们总要工作到凌晨1点。 On Monday night, as the South Korea women’s team was working toward a 5-point lead over Japan, Wuthrich walked away from the ice and sat back for a moment. He imagined himself home in Manitoba, his two black Labrador retrievers nestled on either side of him. He savored the thought, but went back inside, where the curlers were deep in competition, strategizing and shouting. 周一晚，当韩国女子冰壶队领先日本队5分的时候，伍思里希离开冰场，坐下休息了一会儿。他想象自己回到了曼尼托巴省的家中，他的两只黑色拉布拉多依偎在他的两侧。他细细品味着那个画面，但又回到了场内，冰壶选手们激战正酣，制定战略，大声叫喊。 His eyes were on the ice. 他的双眼就注视着那些冰。 Rick Rojas是美国国内新闻记者，报道美国南方的新闻。他自2014年起一直在时报担任记者 翻译：纽约时报中文网 ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/nyt2022021701/"},{"title":"【双语】Trump's Big China Flop and Other Failures","content":"特朗普是个笨蛋，中国人彻底赢过了他 Do you remember Donald Trump’s trade war? You can be forgiven for having forgotten all about it, given everything that has happened since; it sounds trivial compared with his effort to stay in power by overturning a fair election. 还记得唐纳德·特朗普的贸易战吗？考虑到此后发生的一切，你就算彻底忘记了这件事也是情有可原的；与他试图通过推翻一场公平选举来继续掌权的努力相比，贸易战显得微不足道。 Even in terms of policy while in office, it was far less important than his pandemic denial, and probably less important than his tax cuts or his sabotage of health care. 即使只看他任内的政策，贸易战的重要性也远远不及他对大流行的否认，可能都不如他的减税或对医保的破坏。 But the trade war was uniquely Trumpian. His other policy actions were standard-issue Republicanism, but the rest of his party didn’t share his obsession with trade deficits; indeed, he probably wouldn’t have been able to do much on that front except for the fact that U.S. law gives presidents enormous discretion when setting tariffs. 但贸易战是特朗普特有的做法。他的其他政策行动是标准的共和党主义，但其他共和党人不像他那样痴迷于贸易赤字；事实上，如果不是美国法律赋予总统在关税上的自由裁量权，他可能无法在这方面有所作为。 Only Trump really considered trade deficits an important issue; and he, er, trumpeted what he called a “historic trade deal” under which China agreed to buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. goods and services by the end of 2021. 只有特朗普是真的认为贸易逆差是一个重要问题；而且他还鼓吹他所谓的“历史性贸易协议”，根据该协议，中国同意在2021年底前额外购买2000亿美元的美国商品和服务。 Now, Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who has been the go-to source on the trade war from the beginning, has a final assessment of that deal. And it turns out to have been a complete flop: “China bought none of the additional $200 billion of exports Trump’s deal had promised.” 现在，彼得森国际经济研究所的查德·鲍恩（他从一开始就一直是贸易战的最佳信息来源）对该协议做出了最终评估。事实证明，这是一次彻底的失败：“中国完全没有购买在特朗普的协议中所承诺的额外2000亿美元出口。” So Trump was a chump; the Chinese took him to the cleaners. But if you want to do a post-mortem on the trade war, Trump’s haplessness in dealing with foreign leaders is actually a minor part of the story. 所以说特朗普是个笨蛋；中国人彻底赢过了他。但如果你想对贸易战做事后总结，实际上，特朗普与外国领导人打交道方面的无能只是故事的一小部分。 Far more important is the fact that the shocks we’ve been experiencing since the pandemic began make the Trumpian view of trade look even more economically foolish than it did when he took office. 更重要的是，自大流行开始以来，我们经历的冲击使特朗普的贸易观从经济角度看来比他上任时显得更加愚蠢。 In the world according to Trump and Peter Navarro, the man he chose as his trade czar, international trade is a zero-sum game. If other countries buy stuff from America, we win; if we buy stuff made abroad, we lose. 特朗普和他选择的贸易沙皇彼得·纳瓦罗认为，在这个世界上，国际贸易是一个零和游戏。如果其他国家从美国买东西，我们就赢了；如果我们购买国外制造的东西，我们就输了。 Navarro and Wilbur Ross, Trump’s commerce secretary (he really knew how to pick them), made this explicit in a policy paper they put out during the 2016 campaign, which asserted that the trade deficit subtracts one-for-one from U.S. growth: Every dollar we spend on imports reduces our G.D.P. by a dollar. 纳瓦罗和特朗普的商务部长威尔伯·罗斯（特朗普可真会用人）在2016年竞选期间发布的一份政策文件中明确了这一点，它宣称，贸易赤字和美国经济增长是一比一的对应关系：我们在进口上每花一美元，就会使我们的GDP减少一美元。 Economists scoffed at this crude mercantilism, which completely ignored the point that imports can make us richer, because the whole reason we buy some goods from abroad is that they are cheaper and/or better than domestically produced alternatives. 经济学家嘲笑这种粗糙的重商主义，它完全忽视了进口可以让我们更富有这一点，因为我们从国外购买商品，只是因为它们比国内生产的替代品更便宜，并且/或者更好。 This is especially true in the modern world economy, where many products that enter international trade are “intermediate goods,” like parts that are used in production. As it turned out, Trump’s tariffs disproportionately affected intermediate goods. 在现代世界经济中尤其如此，许多进入国际贸易的产品都是“中间产品”，比如用于生产的零部件。事实证明，特朗普的关税过高地影响了中间产品。 So the tariffs raised U.S. production costs and, according to almost all estimates, reduced the number of manufacturing jobs. 因此，关税提高了美国的生产成本，几乎是根据所有估计，它都减少了制造业的就业机会。 Still, mercantilism isn’t always unadulterated nonsense. (Sometimes it’s adulterated nonsense?) Under certain conditions — namely, when the economy is depressed because overall demand is inadequate — trade deficits can reduce output and jobs, and actions to reduce those deficits can act as a form of economic stimulus. 不过，重商主义并不总是纯粹的废话。（有时候是掺了杂质的废话？）在某些情况下，即当经济因总体需求不足而出现萧条时，贸易赤字可减少产出和就业，而减少这些赤字的行动可作为一种经济刺激形式。 That’s why, back in 2010, when lack of demand was the overriding constraint on the U.S. economy, I called for strong pressure on China to end the undervaluation of its currency. 正因如此，在2010年，当需求不足成为制约美国经济的主要因素时，我呼吁向中国施加强大压力，结束人民币的低估值。 And it’s possible that one of these years we will once again find ourselves facing persistent problems of inadequate demand. But that’s not where we are now. 在未来的某一年，我们依旧有可能再次发现自己面临持续的需求不足问题。但这不是我们现在的处境。 We are, instead, currently living in a world of constrained supply — a world, in particular, in which domestic factories are struggling to produce what consumers want. Those supply constraints are why inflation has surged. 相反，我们目前生活在一个供应受限的世界——一个国内工厂难以生产出消费者所需产品的世界。这样的供应限制是通胀飙升的原因。 As we have entered this world, the United States has plunged deeper into trade deficit: 在我们进入这个世界的时候，美国已经陷入更深的贸易赤字： How should we think about this plunge? Would we be richer and better off if we didn’t allow as many imports? 我们应该如何看待这种深陷？如果我们不允许那么多的进口，我们会更富有、过得更好吗？ The answer should be an obvious “no.” As many economists have pointed out, the pandemic has caused consumers, still nervous about face-to-face interaction, to switch from buying services to buying goods: 答案应该是一个明显的“不”。正如许多经济学家指出的，新冠疫情已经导致消费者从购买服务转向购买商品，他们仍然对面对面的互动感到紧张： Imports have surged because many of the goods consumers want are produced abroad, and America doesn’t have the capacity to produce them here — at least not on short notice. 进口激增是因为很多消费者想要的商品都是在国外生产的，而美国没有能力在国内生产它们——至少短期内没有能力。 Furthermore, even when we can satisfy demand with domestic production, that production, the tariff debacle tells us, often requires imported intermediate goods. 此外，即使我们可以用国内生产来满足需求，关税的失败告诉我们，这种生产往往需要进口中间产品。 So if we had tried to block the pandemic-related import surge, we wouldn’t have had more jobs; we would just have had more shortages and even higher inflation. 因此，如果我们试图阻止与大流行相关的进口激增，并不会带来更多的就业；我们只会面临更多的短缺和更高的通胀。 In fact, some economists have urged President Biden to help the fight against inflation by lifting the Trump tariffs — something he could do without congressional approval. 事实上，一些经济学家已经敦促拜登总统通过解除特朗普的关税来帮助对抗通货膨胀——他可以在没有国会批准的情况下这么做。 Unfortunately, it’s easy to see the political and strategic problems with doing this, no matter how much sense it would make. Trump may have been China’s chump, but Republicans would pounce on any action that could be construed as a gift to China, even if continuing Trump’s tariffs hurts us more than it hurts the Chinese government. 不幸的是，这种做法的政治问题和战略问题是显而易见的，无论它本身多么合理。特朗普可能被中国愚弄了，但共和党人还会继续扑向任何最终可能是给中国送大礼的行动，即使继续征收特朗普的关税对我们的伤害大于对中国政府的伤害。 I’ve called today’s newsletter a post-mortem on Trump’s trade war, but, in fact, that trade war isn’t over. Trump’s trade policies were foolish and costly — they failed by any measure you choose — but it may be a long time before any president is in a position to undo the damage. 我把今天的时事通讯称为特朗普贸易战的事后剖析，但事实上，贸易战并没有结束。特朗普的贸易政策既愚蠢又昂贵——无论你用什么标准衡量，它们都是失败的——但任何一位总统都可能需要很长一段时间才能挽回损失。 保罗·克鲁格曼(Paul Krugman)自2000年以来一直是时报的专栏作家。他也是纽约市立大学研究生中心的杰出教授。克鲁格曼因在国际贸易和经济地理方面的成就获得2008年诺贝尔经济学奖 翻译：纽约时报中文网 ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/nyt2022021601/"},{"title":"The Economist – February 12, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：q2rv ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220212/"},{"title":"The Economist – February 05, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：vf64 ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220205/"},{"title":"The Economist – January 29, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：95cv ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220129/"},{"title":"The Economist – January 22, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：z4e6 ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220122/"},{"title":"The Economist – January 15, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：t7ah ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20020115/"},{"title":"The Economist – January 08, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：fqpj ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220108/"},{"title":"The Economist – January 01, 2022","content":" 📩下载链接📩 点击下载 提取码：m5qn ❗️若链接失效请及时联系站主 📭hsyslr@outlook.com ","link":"https://iraxu.github.io/post/te20220101/"}]}
